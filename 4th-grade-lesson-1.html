<h4>📚  Welcome to Your Reading Adventure!</h4>
<p>Hey there, reader! Today is Day 1 of a big year. Over the next 180 lessons, you are going to read incredible stories, travel the world, meet unforgettable characters, and become a stronger reader and writer than you ever thought possible.</p>
<p>But first — we start with a girl named Dorothy, a little dog named Toto, and a really, really big storm.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 1 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (“The Cyclone”)</li>
<li>Answer questions about what you read</li>
<li>Write your very first journal entry</li>
<li>Learn a new vocabulary word</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<p>Ready? Let’s go.</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let’s think for a moment.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Imagine a huge storm is coming — the biggest storm you’ve ever seen. The wind is shaking your house. What would you do? What would you grab? Where would you hide?</p>
<br>
<p>Hold that thought. Dorothy is about to face exactly this situation. As you read, pay attention to what she does when the storm hits. Does she react the way you would?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for while you read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Where does Dorothy live? What is her life like before the storm?</li>
<li>What happens when the cyclone hits?</li>
<li>How does Dorothy feel? How do you know?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read Chapter 1 — “The Cyclone”</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and read Chapter 1: “The Cyclone.”</p>
<br>
<p>This is a short chapter — it should take about 10-15 minutes to read.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: </h4>
<p>Don’t rush! If you hit a word you don’t know, try reading the sentence around it to figure out what it means. That’s called using “context clues” — and it’s a superpower you’ll build all year.</p>
<br>
<p>When you’re done reading, come back here and keep going. ⬇️</p>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>cyclone  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>A powerful, spinning windstorm that can cause great destruction.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: “From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm.”</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Why do you think L. Frank Baum chose to start Dorothy’s story with a cyclone? What does it do to the story right away?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Let’s see what you picked up from Chapter 1. Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. Where does Dorothy live at the beginning of the story?</div>
<p>A) A big city with tall buildings</p>
<p>B) The Kansas prairies with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em</p>
<p>C) A forest near a river</p>
<p>D) A small island in the ocean</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How does the author describe the land where Dorothy lives?</div>
<p>A) Green, lush, and full of flowers</p>
<p>B) Gray, flat, and dry</p>
<p>C) Covered in snow and ice</p>
<p>D) Rocky with mountains all around</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. What does Dorothy do when the cyclone hits?</div>
<p>A) She runs outside to watch it</p>
<p>B) She hides under the bed</p>
<p>C) She tries to get to the cellar but the house is carried away</p>
<p>D) She climbs a tree to stay safe</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. How do you think Dorothy feels when the house is spinning in the air? Use one detail from the chapter to support your answer.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Look for sentences that describe what Dorothy does or thinks while the house is in the air.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. The author spends a lot of time describing Kansas as gray and dull. Why do you think he does that? What might he be setting up?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about contrast — if Kansas is gray, what might that tell you about where Dorothy is going?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>This is your reading journal. You’re going to write in it every single lesson this year. By the end, you’ll have a whole book of your own thoughts about every story you’ve read. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<br>
<p>Today’s journal entry:</p>
<br>
<p>Write 2-3 sentences about Chapter 1. You can answer any of these questions, or write about whatever stuck with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened in this chapter?</li>
<li>What surprised you?</li>
<li>What do you think will happen next?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: Start each sentence with a capital letter and end it with a period. That’s it — just 2-3 good sentences.</h4>
<br>
<p>My Journal Entry:</p>
<p>[Write your journal entry here]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>🌟  You’re Done with Day 1!</h4>
<p>Nice work! You just finished your very first lesson. Here’s what you accomplished today:</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Read Chapter 1 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h4>
<h4>✅  Learned a new vocabulary word (cyclone)</h4>
<h4>✅  Answered comprehension questions about the text</h4>
<h4>✅  Wrote your first reading journal entry</h4>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow in Lesson 2, you’ll read Chapter 2 and find out where Dorothy’s house landed. (Spoiler: it’s not Kansas anymore.)</p>
<br>
<p>See you tomorrow, reader. 📚</p>
