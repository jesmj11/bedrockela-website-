<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Ten lessons in! Before we dive deeper into the story, let’s pause and look at how far you’ve come. You’ve read 11 chapters, met all the main characters, and written 9 journal entries. That’s seriously impressive.</p>
<br>
<p>Today is a little different. You’ll read a new chapter AND look back at the story so far.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 12 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>Review the story so far with a character chart</li>
<li>Write a longer journal entry reflecting on the first 11 chapters</li>
<li>Think about the big ideas (themes) in this story</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50-55 minutes (a little longer today!)</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Before you read today’s chapter, let’s take stock of what we know. Fill in this character chart from memory (it’s okay to flip back through your book to check!):</p>
<br>
<p>Dorothy: Wants ________________. One thing she’s done that shows who she really is: ________________.</p>
<p>Scarecrow: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.</p>
<p>Tin Woodman: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.</p>
<p>Cowardly Lion: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for in Chapter 12:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How does the Wicked Witch find out the group is coming?</li>
<li>What weapons does the Witch use against them?</li>
<li>Do the characters show their “missing” qualities during the battle?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read — Review & Chapter 12: The Search for the Wicked Witch</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 12: “The Search for the Wicked Witch.”</p>
<br>
<p>This is an action-packed chapter. The Wicked Witch of the West sends several attacks at the group. Pay attention to how each character responds when things get really scary.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: This is a long chapter with a lot happening. It’s okay to pause in the middle and take a breath. If you need to, re-read a section that was confusing. Good readers re-read all the time.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<p>melancholy  (adjective / noun)</p>
<p>A deep, quiet sadness. Not dramatic crying, but a heavy, lingering feeling of sadness.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: The Tin Woodman feels melancholy when he thinks about the heart he lost. It’s not a loud sadness — it’s a quiet ache.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: What’s the difference between being sad and being melancholy? Can you think of a time you felt melancholy instead of just plain sad?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. How does the Wicked Witch of the West see the group coming?</div>
<p>A) She uses a crystal ball</p>
<p>B) She has one eye that is as powerful as a telescope</p>
<p>C) A spy tells her</p>
<p>D) She sees them from her window</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. Which of these does the Wicked Witch send to attack the group?</div>
<p>A) Dragons and giants</p>
<p>B) Wolves, crows, bees, and Winkies</p>
<p>C) A tornado</p>
<p>D) An army of witches</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Thinking about the whole story so far — which statement best describes a theme (big idea) of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?</div>
<p>A) Witches are always evil</p>
<p>B) You might already have what you’re looking for inside you</p>
<p>C) Home is a boring place</p>
<p>D) Only wizards can solve your problems</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Look back at the character chart you filled in before reading. Pick one character and write 2-3 sentences explaining how they have shown their “missing” quality through their ACTIONS in the story, even though they say they don’t have it.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Use specific examples. “The Scarecrow says he has no brain, but in Chapter 7 he came up with the plan to...”</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. We’re about halfway through the book. The biggest theme we’ve seen is: “You might already have what you’re looking for.” Do you agree or disagree that the characters already have what they want? Use at least two examples from the story.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: This is your first mini-essay answer! Try to write 3-4 sentences with examples from different parts of the book.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>Special Day 10 journal entry — write a FULL PARAGRAPH today (4-5 sentences!):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Look back at your journal entries from Days 1-9. How has the story changed since the beginning? How have YOUR thoughts about it changed?</li>
<li>If you could talk to one character and give them advice, who would you choose and what would you say?</li>
<li>What is the biggest question you have about the story right now? What do you think the answer might be?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: This is your longest journal entry yet! A paragraph = topic sentence + 3-4 detail sentences. You’ve been building to this. You’re ready.</h4>
<br>
