<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Dorothy defeated the Wicked Witch (with a bucket of water, of all things!). Now the group is heading back to the Emerald City to collect on the Wizard’s promise. But will the Wizard keep his word?</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapters 13 and 14</li>
<li>Learn about the Winged Monkeys’ backstory</li>
<li>Practice summarizing</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>The Wicked Witch is gone. Dorothy has the Golden Cap and the silver shoes. The group should be celebrating, right? But they still haven’t gotten what they came for.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Have you ever completed a hard task only to realize there’s still more to do? How did that feel?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How do the Winged Monkeys help Dorothy?</li>
<li>What is the Monkeys’ story? Why do they obey the Golden Cap?</li>
<li>What happens when the group returns to the Emerald City?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 13: “The Rescue” and Chapter 14: “The Winged Monkeys.”</p>
<br>
<p>Chapter 13 is short. Chapter 14 includes a backstory about the Winged Monkeys — it explains their history. Backstories give you new information about a character’s past.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Summarizing means retelling the most important parts in your own words — not every detail, just the big events. Try to summarize each chapter in one sentence after you read it.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<p>captive  (noun / adjective)</p>
<p>A person or creature that is held prisoner and not free to leave.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: The Winkies were captives of the Wicked Witch. When Dorothy defeated the Witch, they were finally free.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: How does it feel to go from being a captive to being free? How do you think the Winkies felt?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. How does Dorothy summon the Winged Monkeys?</div>
<p>A) She whistles for them</p>
<p>B) She uses the Golden Cap</p>
<p>C) She asks the Good Witch</p>
<p>D) They come on their own</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. Why do the Winged Monkeys obey the owner of the Golden Cap?</div>
<p>A) They are afraid</p>
<p>B) They were cursed long ago and must obey three commands from whoever wears the Cap</p>
<p>C) They are loyal to Dorothy</p>
<p>D) The Wizard ordered them to</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Summarize Chapters 13 and 14 in 2-3 sentences. Include only the most important events.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Ask yourself: What were the two biggest things that happened? Leave out small details.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. The Winged Monkeys have their own backstory. Why do you think the author included it? How does it change the way you see the Monkeys?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Before this chapter, the Monkeys seemed like villains. Does their story change that?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Today’s journal entry (write a paragraph — 4-5 sentences):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Summarize what has happened in the story so far in your own words.</li>
<li>Did learning the Monkeys’ backstory change how you feel about them? Explain.</li>
<li>What do you predict will happen when the group meets the Wizard again?</li>
</ul>
<br>
