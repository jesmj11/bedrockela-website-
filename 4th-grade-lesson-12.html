<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>This is one of the most famous chapters in children’s literature. Everything you thought you knew about the Wizard is about to change. Ready?</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 15 — the Wizard’s secret is revealed!</li>
<li>Explore the theme of appearance vs. reality</li>
<li>Practice finding the main idea</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Remember the green glasses everyone has to wear in the Emerald City? Remember how the Wizard looked different to everyone? The author has been dropping clues. Today, those clues pay off.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Have you ever discovered that something you believed was real turned out to be fake or exaggerated? How did you feel?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the Wizard’s secret?</li>
<li>How does each character react?</li>
<li>What is the main idea of this chapter?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 15: “The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible.”</p>
<br>
<p>This chapter changes everything. Read slowly and enjoy the moment when the truth comes out.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: The main idea is the most important point the author is making. It’s not a detail — it’s the BIG message. After reading, ask: “What is this chapter really about?”</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>humbug  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>A fraud or fake. Someone who deceives people by pretending to be something they’re not.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: “I’m just a common man,” the Wizard admits. He’s a humbug — he was never magical at all.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is the Wizard a bad person for being a humbug, or was he just doing what he thought he had to do? Can someone be a fraud but still be a good person?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What is the Wizard’s big secret?</div>
<p>A) He is actually a powerful sorcerer from another world</p>
<p>B) He is an ordinary man from Omaha who used tricks to seem powerful</p>
<p>C) He is a Munchkin in disguise</p>
<p>D) He is Dorothy’s grandfather</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is the MAIN IDEA of this chapter?</div>
<p>A) Wizards are always liars</p>
<p>B) Things are not always what they appear to be — power can be an illusion</p>
<p>C) Dorothy should have stayed in Kansas</p>
<p>D) The Emerald City is the best place in Oz</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. How did the Wizard make the Emerald City look green?</div>
<p>A) He painted everything green</p>
<p>B) He used real emeralds on every building</p>
<p>C) He made everyone wear green-tinted glasses so everything looked green</p>
<p>D) He cast a spell on the city</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. The Wizard says he is a “humbug.” But does he still try to help Dorothy and her friends? What does that tell you about him as a character?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: A person can be flawed (a humbug) and still be kind. Does the Wizard try to make things right?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Appearance vs. reality is a big theme in this story. List THREE examples from the book where something appeared one way but turned out to be different.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about: the Emerald City, the Wizard himself, and what the Scarecrow/Tin Woodman/Lion say about themselves vs. what they actually do.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>

<li>What is the main idea of this chapter in your own words?</li>
</ul>
