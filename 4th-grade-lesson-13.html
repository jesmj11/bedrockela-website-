<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>The Wizard is a fake. Everyone knows it now. But he made a promise, and today he’s going to try to keep it — in the cleverest way possible.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 16</li>
<li>Think about whether the Wizard’s “gifts” are real</li>
<li>Dig deeper into theme</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>The Wizard has no magic. So how can he give the Scarecrow a brain, the Tin Woodman a heart, and the Lion courage? Watch closely — and think about whether what he gives them is real or symbolic.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Can someone GIVE you confidence, or do you have to find it yourself? What if someone just tells you that you already have it?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does the Wizard give each character?</li>
<li>Are the gifts real?</li>
<li>Do the characters feel different afterward? Why?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 16: “The Magic Art of the Great Humbug.”</p>
<br>
<p>This is a short but powerful chapter. The Wizard gives each character a “gift” — but are they what they seem?</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Theme is the big lesson or message the author wants you to take away from the story. This chapter is dripping with theme. Ask yourself: What is L. Frank Baum really saying about brains, hearts, and courage?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>wisdom  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>The ability to use knowledge and experience to make good decisions. It’s more than just being smart — it’s knowing how to USE what you know.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: The Wizard tells the Scarecrow that true wisdom comes from experience, not from what’s inside your head.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is wisdom the same as being smart? Can someone be smart but not wise? Can someone be wise without knowing a lot of facts?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What does the Wizard give the Scarecrow for a “brain”?</div>
<p>A) A real human brain</p>
<p>B) A magic potion</p>
<p>C) Bran, pins, and needles stuffed in his head</p>
<p>D) A book of knowledge</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. Why do the characters feel satisfied with their gifts even though they’re not real?</div>
<p>A) The Wizard cast a secret spell</p>
<p>B) They believe they have what they wanted, and that belief makes the difference</p>
<p>C) The gifts are actually magical</p>
<p>D) They’re pretending to be happy</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. The Wizard gives fake brains, a fake heart, and fake courage. But the characters are happy. What is the author’s message? What is the theme?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about this: Did the characters need the Wizard at all? What did they really need?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Do you think the Wizard did the right thing by giving fake gifts? Or should he have told them the truth — that they already had brains, heart, and courage all along? Explain your opinion.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: There’s no wrong answer here. Just support your opinion with reasoning.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Today’s journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>In your own words, what is the theme of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz? What is the author trying to teach us?</li>
<li>Do you think the Wizard is wise? Why or why not?</li>
<li>If you could ask the Wizard for one thing, what would it be? Do you think you might already have it?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: Today, try to connect your journal to the THEME of the story, not just what happened.</h4>
<br>
