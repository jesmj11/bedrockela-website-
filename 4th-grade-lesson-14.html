<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Everyone else got what they wanted. But what about Dorothy? She still needs to get home to Kansas. Today, the Wizard tries one more thing — and Dorothy’s journey takes another turn.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapters 17 and 18</li>
<li>Track Dorothy’s journey toward home</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>The Wizard gave brains, a heart, and courage. But Dorothy’s wish is different — she wants to go HOME. Can a humbug wizard get her there?</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: What makes a place feel like home? Is it the building? The people? The memories?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the Wizard’s plan to get Dorothy home?</li>
<li>Does it work?</li>
<li>Who does Dorothy go to see next for help?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 17: “How the Balloon Was Launched” and Chapter 18: “Away to the South.”</p>
<br>
<p>The Wizard’s balloon plan is... well, you’ll see. Then the group heads south to find Glinda, the Good Witch. The journey isn’t over yet.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: We’re getting close to the end. Start thinking about how everything connects. How has Dorothy changed from Chapter 1?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>journey  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>A long trip, especially one that changes you along the way. A journey is more than just travel — it’s about growth.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Dorothy’s journey through Oz has changed her. She started as a lonely girl in gray Kansas and became a brave leader with loyal friends.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: What’s the difference between a trip and a journey? How has Dorothy’s journey changed her?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What is the Wizard’s plan to get Dorothy home?</div>
<p>A) He will use magic</p>
<p>B) He builds a hot air balloon to fly them both back</p>
<p>C) He gives her a magic carpet</p>
<p>D) He asks the Winged Monkeys to carry her</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. Why doesn’t the plan work?</div>
<p>A) The balloon pops</p>
<p>B) The balloon flies away before Dorothy can get in</p>
<p>C) Dorothy changes her mind about leaving</p>
<p>D) The Wizard falls out</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Dorothy has now been let down by the Wizard twice — first he was a humbug, now his balloon left without her. How does Dorothy respond? What does that tell you about her character?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Does she give up? Or does she find another plan? What quality does that show?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Think about Dorothy at the beginning of the book vs. Dorothy now. List two ways she has changed. Use specific examples.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Chapter 1 Dorothy was swept away by a storm with no control. Now Dorothy is making her own decisions and leading a group.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Today’s journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How has Dorothy changed from the beginning to now? Be specific.</li>
<li>If you were Dorothy, would you still want to go back to gray Kansas? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think Glinda will tell Dorothy?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: When you write about how a character has changed, use “At the beginning... but now...” to show the contrast.</h4>
