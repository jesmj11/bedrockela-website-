<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>This is it — the final chapters of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Today you’ll find out how Dorothy gets home, and you’ll finish your first novel of the year. That’s a big deal!</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the final chapters (19-24) — finish the book!</li>
<li>Identify the theme of the entire novel</li>
<li>Write a response about the ending</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 55 minutes (it’s worth it!)</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>The end of a book is when all the pieces come together. Everything the author has been building — the characters, the theme, the journey — reaches its conclusion. Savor it.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Before you read, make one final prediction: How do you think Dorothy gets home?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How does Glinda help Dorothy?</li>
<li>What was the answer all along?</li>
<li>How do the friends say goodbye?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapters 19 through 24 (the end of the book).</p>
<br>
<p>Some of these final chapters have adventures on the way to Glinda. The most important chapters are the last two, where Glinda reveals the secret of the silver shoes and Dorothy goes home.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: When you finish, sit with it for a moment. How do you feel? What sticks with you? That feeling IS the theme working on you.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>grateful  (adjective)</strong></div>
<p>Feeling thankful and appreciating what you have, even if it’s simple.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: When Dorothy clicks her silver shoes and lands in Kansas, she is grateful to be home — even though Kansas is still gray and flat.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Why is Dorothy grateful for Kansas now, when she wasn’t at the beginning? What changed — Kansas, or Dorothy?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. How does Dorothy finally get home?</div>
<p>A) The Wizard comes back with a new balloon</p>
<p>B) She clicks the silver shoes together three times</p>
<p>C) The Winged Monkeys carry her</p>
<p>D) She walks back on the yellow brick road</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is ironic (unexpected) about how Dorothy gets home?</div>
<p>A) She had to defeat two witches first</p>
<p>B) She could have gone home at any time — the silver shoes had the power all along</p>
<p>C) Kansas wasn’t real</p>
<p>D) Glinda tricked her</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Which statement BEST describes the theme of the whole novel?</div>
<p>A) Magic can solve all your problems</p>
<p>B) What you’re looking for has been inside you (or with you) all along</p>
<p>C) Kansas is better than Oz</p>
<p>D) Witches are dangerous</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. The Scarecrow always had a brain. The Tin Woodman always had a heart. The Lion always had courage. Dorothy always had the power to go home. What is the author telling us about people and what they’re looking for?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: This is the BIG THEME question. Take your time with it.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Write a 3-4 sentence summary of the ENTIRE book. Hit only the biggest, most important events.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: A good whole-book summary covers: who the main character is, what they want, the biggest challenge, and how it ends.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Special end-of-book journal entry (write a FULL PARAGRAPH — 5-6 sentences!):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>What did you think of the ending? Was it satisfying? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What is the biggest lesson this book teaches? Do you agree with it?</li>
<li>Which character will you remember most, and why?</li>
</ul>
