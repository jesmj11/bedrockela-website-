            <p class="meta">Greek Mythology  •  Atalanta’s Race</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Not all Greek heroes are men with swords. Today you’ll meet Atalanta — a woman who was raised by bears, could outrun anyone alive, and refused to let anyone tell her what she couldn’t do.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the myth of Atalanta</li>
<li>Think about how this hero is different from the others</li>
<li>Compare heroes across all four stories</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>So far, Perseus and Theseus both follow the Hero’s Journey pretty closely. Does Atalanta? Watch for how her story is similar AND how it breaks the pattern.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Have you ever been told you couldn’t do something because of who you are? How did you respond?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How is Atalanta different from the other heroes?</li>
<li>What is her greatest strength?</li>
<li>Does her story follow the Hero’s Journey, or is it different?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read the myth of Atalanta.</p>
<br>
<p>Atalanta was abandoned as a baby and raised by bears. She grew up to be the fastest runner in all of Greece. When told she must marry, she set a condition: anyone who wanted to marry her had to beat her in a race. If they lost, they died.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Think about what Atalanta’s story says about strength. Is she strong in the same way as Perseus and Theseus, or in a different way?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>determination  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>The quality of being firm in your purpose. Not giving up, no matter what.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Atalanta’s determination made her unstoppable. No one could beat her because she refused to lose.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Which of our heroes shows the most determination — Dorothy, Perseus, Theseus, or Atalanta? Why?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What makes Atalanta different from Perseus and Theseus?</div>
<p>A) She is a woman hero in a world dominated by men</p>
<p>B) She has no challenges to face</p>
<p>C) She uses magic</p>
<p>D) She doesn’t go on a journey</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is Atalanta’s greatest strength?</div>
<p>A) Magic powers</p>
<p>B) Her speed and determination</p>
<p>C) An army that fights for her</p>
<p>D) A magic weapon</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. How is Atalanta’s heroism different from the other heroes we’ve read about? What makes her unique?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what she’s fighting for and against. She’s not just fighting a monster — she’s fighting a whole society’s expectations.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. You’ve now read about FOUR heroes: Dorothy, Perseus, Theseus, and Atalanta. If you had to pick one quality that ALL heroes share, what would it be? Support your answer with an example from at least two stories.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think beyond “bravery.” What deeper quality connects all four?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Today’s journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Which of the four heroes (Dorothy, Perseus, Theseus, Atalanta) do you relate to most? Why?</li>
<li>What is ONE quality all heroes share? Use examples from the stories.</li>
<li>How is Atalanta’s story similar to and different from Dorothy’s?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: You’re becoming a stronger writer every day. Try to include a specific example from the text in your response today.</h4>

<h4>🌟  You’re Done!</h4>
<p>Great work today! Here’s what you accomplished:</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Read the myth of Atalanta</h4>
<h4>✅  Compared FOUR hero stories</h4>
<h4>✅  Thought about what makes a hero across cultures</h4>
<h4>✅  Learned a new vocabulary word (determination)</h4>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow, you’ll learn about a story pattern called the Hero’s Journey and map out how it works across ALL the stories you’ve read. Then you’ll start planning your OWN hero story!</p>
<br>
<p>See you next lesson, reader. 📚</p>
