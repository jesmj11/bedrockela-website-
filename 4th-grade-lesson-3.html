        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Dorothy knows she needs to get home. But how? Today she’ll set off on a journey to find someone who might be able to help — and she’ll meet a very unusual friend along the way.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 3 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>Meet a new character and think about what makes him interesting</li>
<li>Answer questions about character traits</li>
<li>Write in your reading journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>In Chapter 2, the Witch of the North told Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where the great Wizard of Oz lives. He might be able to help her get home.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: If you were starting a long journey and could bring one friend, who would you want with you? What qualities would make someone a great travel companion?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for while you read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Who does Dorothy meet on the road?</li>
<li>What does this new character want more than anything?</li>
<li>What details tell you about his personality?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 3: How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 3: “How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow.”</p>
<br>
<p>Pay close attention to the Scarecrow. He’s going to be important. Notice how he talks, what he says about himself, and what he wishes for.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: When you meet a new character, ask yourself three questions: What do they look like? What do they want? What kind of person (or scarecrow!) are they?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>queer  (adjective)</strong></div>
<p>In this book, “queer” means strange or unusual. (Note: This word was commonly used this way in 1900 when the book was written. Language changes over time!)</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: “It was a queer thing to see a scarecrow wink at you.”</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: What makes the Scarecrow “queer” or strange? Why is Dorothy surprised by him?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What does the Scarecrow want more than anything?</div>
<p>A) A heart</p>
<p>B) Courage</p>
<p>C) A brain</p>
<p>D) To go back to Kansas</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How does Dorothy help the Scarecrow?</div>
<p>A) She gives him food and water</p>
<p>B) She lifts him down off his pole</p>
<p>C) She reads him a book</p>
<p>D) She teaches him how to walk</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Why does the Scarecrow decide to go with Dorothy to the Emerald City?</div>
<p>A) He wants to ask the Wizard for a brain</p>
<p>B) He is scared to be alone</p>
<p>C) Dorothy forces him to come</p>
<p>D) He wants to see Kansas</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Even though the Scarecrow says he has no brain, does he seem smart to you? Find one thing the Scarecrow says or does that makes you think he might already be smarter than he realizes.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Look at the conversations he has with Dorothy. Does he say anything thoughtful or clever?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Dorothy and the Scarecrow both want something they don’t have. Dorothy wants to go home. The Scarecrow wants a brain. How are their wishes similar? How are they different?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what “wanting something you don’t have” feels like for both characters.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>Today’s journal entry (2-3 sentences):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>What do you think of the Scarecrow so far? Do you like him? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you think the Scarecrow really needs a brain? Explain.</li>
<li>What do you predict will happen next on the journey?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: Try to mention the character’s name and one thing they said or did.</h4>
