<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Welcome to Unit 2! You just finished a story told by a narrator OUTSIDE the story (third person). Now you’re about to read a story told by someone INSIDE it. Meet Jim Hawkins — he’s going to tell you his story himself.</p>
<br>
<p>Treasure Island is darker, grittier, and more suspenseful than Oz. There are pirates, treasure maps, double-crossings, and danger around every corner.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapters 1-2 of Treasure Island</li>
<li>Learn the difference between 1st and 3rd person point of view</li>
<li>Meet Jim Hawkins and notice how HIS voice tells the story</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a narrator told us Dorothy’s story from the outside. That’s called THIRD PERSON — the narrator uses “she,” “he,” “they.”</p>
<br>
<p>In Treasure Island, Jim Hawkins tells his OWN story using “I” and “me.” That’s FIRST PERSON. You can only know what Jim knows, see what Jim sees, feel what Jim feels.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: What’s the difference between someone telling you about a scary experience vs. hearing it from the person who lived it?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Find sentences where Jim uses “I” — this is first person</li>
<li>What do we learn about Jim from the way he tells his story?</li>
<li>Who is Billy Bones? What makes him frightening?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy of Treasure Island and read Chapters 1-2: “The Old Sea-Dog at the Admiral Benbow” and “Black Dog Appears and Disappears.”</p>
<br>
<p>This book was written in 1883, so the language is older than Oz. Some words will feel unfamiliar. Use context clues and keep going — it gets easier.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Pay attention to Jim’s VOICE. How does he sound? Nervous? Brave? Curious? In first person, the narrator’s personality comes through in every sentence.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>rogue  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>A dishonest or unprincipled person. Someone who can’t be trusted and may cause trouble.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Billy Bones is clearly a rogue — he drinks too much, scares the guests, and is hiding from someone dangerous.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is a rogue the same as a villain? Can someone be a rogue but still be interesting or even likeable?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. How do you know Treasure Island is told in FIRST PERSON?</div>
<p>A) It uses “she” and “he”</p>
<p>B) Jim uses “I” and “me” to tell his own story</p>
<p>C) A narrator outside the story describes Jim</p>
<p>D) It’s written as a play</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is the setting at the beginning of the story?</div>
<p>A) A pirate ship at sea</p>
<p>B) The Admiral Benbow Inn, run by Jim’s family</p>
<p>C) A tropical island</p>
<p>D) A castle in England</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. What makes Billy Bones frightening?</div>
<p>A) He is kind to everyone</p>
<p>B) He is a rough, scarred sailor who drinks heavily and threatens people</p>
<p>C) He has magical powers</p>
<p>D) He is related to Jim</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Find three sentences where Jim uses “I” or “me.” How does hearing the story from Jim’s own mouth feel different from how Wizard of Oz was told?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about intimacy. In first person, you’re inside someone’s head. In third person, you’re watching from outside.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Based on these first two chapters, what kind of person is Jim Hawkins? What are his character traits? Use evidence from the text.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Is he brave? Scared? Curious? Look at what he does and how he describes things.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Today’s journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does Treasure Island FEEL different from Wizard of Oz? (Think about tone, narrator, setting.)</li>
<li>What are your first impressions of Jim Hawkins?</li>
<li>What do you predict will happen with Billy Bones?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: You’re starting a new book! Compare how this opening feels to the opening of Wizard of Oz.</h4>
