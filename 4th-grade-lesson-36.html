<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>This is it. The chapter that changes the entire story. Jim climbs into an apple barrel for a snack — and overhears something he was never meant to hear.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 11 — the apple barrel scene</li>
<li>Experience dramatic irony (when the reader knows something characters don’t)</li>
<li>Analyze how POV makes this scene powerful</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>When a character discovers a secret that changes how they see everyone, it’s a turning point. Jim is trapped on a ship with the very people he now fears.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Imagine finding out someone you liked and trusted was lying the whole time. How would that feel?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does Jim overhear Silver saying?</li>
<li>How does this change Jim’s feelings about Silver?</li>
<li>What is “dramatic irony” and how does this scene create it?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read Chapter 11: “What I Heard in the Apple Barrel.” Read it slowly. This is the chapter everyone remembers.</p>
<br>
<p>Jim hides in the barrel and hears Silver talking to the crew. What Silver says reveals his true nature.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Key term: DRAMATIC IRONY is when the reader (or a character) knows something that other characters don’t. After this chapter, Jim knows Silver’s secret — but Silver doesn’t know Jim knows. That creates incredible tension.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>treachery  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>Betrayal of trust. When someone you believed was on your side turns out to be working against you.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Silver’s treachery is revealed in the apple barrel. The friendly cook was plotting mutiny all along.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is treachery worse than simple cruelty? Why does betrayal by someone you trusted hurt more than harm from a stranger?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What does Jim discover in the apple barrel?</div>
<p>A) Weapons hidden by the captain</p>
<p>B) Long John Silver is plotting a mutiny to steal the treasure</p>
<p>C) A secret compartment in the ship</p>
<p>D) A letter from Billy Bones</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is dramatic irony?</div>
<p>A) When something funny happens</p>
<p>B) When the reader or a character knows something others don’t</p>
<p>C) When the ending is surprising</p>
<p>D) When characters say the opposite of what they mean</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Why is this scene so effective in first person?</div>
<p>A) We experience Jim’s shock and fear in real time, inside his head</p>
<p>B) Third person would have been more suspenseful</p>
<p>C) Jim doesn’t understand what he hears</p>
<p>D) The scene would work the same in any POV</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. In Chapter 8, Jim liked Silver. Now he hears Silver plotting mutiny. Write 3-4 sentences about how Jim’s view of Silver has changed and how it feels to discover a betrayal.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Connect to the word treachery. Think about the feeling of discovering someone you trusted has been lying.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. After this chapter, Jim knows about the mutiny but Silver doesn’t know Jim knows. How will this dramatic irony create tension ahead? Predict.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Every scene where Jim and Silver are together will now be charged with tension.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
