<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Dorothy and the Scarecrow are walking down the yellow brick road together. Today they’ll enter a dark forest and find someone who’s been stuck in the same spot for a very long time. You’re reading two shorter chapters today!</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapters 4 and 5 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>Meet another important character</li>
<li>Compare two characters</li>
<li>Write in your reading journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes (two chapters today!)</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>You’ve met Dorothy (wants to go home) and the Scarecrow (wants a brain). A pattern is forming — characters who are missing something important. Watch for it.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: What do you think is more important — being smart (having a brain) or being kind (having a heart)? There’s no wrong answer here.</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for while you read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Who do Dorothy and the Scarecrow find in the forest?</li>
<li>What does this new character want?</li>
<li>How is his wish different from the Scarecrow’s?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 4: The Road Through the Forest & Chapter 5: The Rescue of the Tin Woodman</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 4: “The Road Through the Forest” and Chapter 5: “The Rescue of the Tin Woodman.”</p>
<br>
<p>Chapter 4 is very short. Chapter 5 is where the real action happens. You can read them both in one sitting.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: The Tin Woodman tells a long story about his past. Pay attention — it explains why he wants what he wants.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<p>tenderly  (adverb)</p>
<p>In a gentle, caring, loving way.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: The Tin Woodman tells Dorothy he once loved a girl “tenderly” — but without a heart, he can no longer feel love.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Why is it sad that the Tin Woodman used to do things tenderly but now says he can’t? What does that tell you about what he’s lost?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. Why is the Tin Woodman stuck in the forest?</div>
<p>A) He is lost and doesn’t know the way</p>
<p>B) He has rusted and cannot move</p>
<p>C) A witch put a spell on him</p>
<p>D) He is too scared to leave</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What does the Tin Woodman want the Wizard to give him?</div>
<p>A) A brain</p>
<p>B) Courage</p>
<p>C) A heart</p>
<p>D) A new body</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. How did the Tin Woodman become made of tin?</div>
<p>A) He was born that way</p>
<p>B) A witch enchanted his axe and it slowly cut away his body, which was replaced with tin</p>
<p>C) He fell into a magical river</p>
<p>D) The Wizard turned him into tin</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. The Scarecrow wants a brain. The Tin Woodman wants a heart. Which do you think is more important? Use an example from the story to explain your thinking.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what each character CAN already do, even without the thing they want.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. The Tin Woodman cries when he’s sad — but says he has no heart. Does that seem strange to you? What might the author be trying to show us?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: If someone cries because they feel sad, what does that tell you about whether they really have feelings?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>Today’s journal entry (2-3 sentences):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Compare the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. How are they similar? How are they different?</li>
<li>Do you think the Tin Woodman already has a heart? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Which character is your favorite so far? Why?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: You read two chapters today! You can write about either one (or both).</h4>
<br>

<p>[Write your journal entry here]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>🌟  You’re Done!</h4>
<p>Great work today! Here’s what you accomplished:</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Read TWO chapters today — Chapters 4 and 5!</h4>
<h4>✅  Met the Tin Woodman</h4>
<h4>✅  Compared two characters (Scarecrow vs. Tin Woodman)</h4>
<h4>✅  Wrote in your reading journal (Day 4!)</h4>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow, the group will meet one more friend who’s missing something. (Hint: he’s big, furry, and not at all scary.) Can you guess who?</p>
<br>
<p>See you next lesson, reader. 📚</p>
