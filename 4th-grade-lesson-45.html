        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>The last two chapters. The treasure is secured. The pirates are defeated. Time for the voyage home — and for saying goodbye to one of literature’s most complicated characters.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the final chapters of Treasure Island</li>
<li>Reflect on Jim’s complete character arc</li>
<li>Think about what happens to Silver</li>
<li>Write a reflective journal about the whole novel</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Two big questions: (1) How has Jim changed from Chapter 1? (2) What happens to Silver — and does he get what he deserves?</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Does every villain deserve punishment? Is Silver’s story more complicated than that?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does Silver do at the end?</li>
<li>How does Jim describe his feelings about the adventure?</li>
<li>Does Jim seem like the same person as Chapter 1?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read Chapters 33-34 — the conclusion. Pay attention to the final paragraphs. Jim’s last words reveal how the journey changed him.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Great endings echo the beginning. Compare the first page to the last page.</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<p>transformation (revisited)  (noun)</p>
<p>You learned this on Day 30. Jim has been transformed by his journey. But his transformation is darker and more complicated than Dorothy’s.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Jim’s transformation is not purely joyful. He’s gained courage and experience, but also seen violence and betrayal that will stay with him.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: How is Jim’s transformation different from Dorothy’s? Dorothy went home happy. Jim went home changed in a more complicated way.</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What happens to Long John Silver at the end?</div>
<p>A) Captured and imprisoned</p>
<p>B) Killed in battle</p>
<p>C) He escapes with some treasure and disappears</p>
<p>D) Becomes captain</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How does Jim feel about the adventure in his final narration?</div>
<p>A) Thrilled and wants to go back</p>
<p>B) Mixed feelings — grateful but haunted by what he saw</p>
<p>C) Angry at everyone</p>
<p>D) Doesn’t care</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Compare Jim in Chapter 1 to Jim in Chapter 34. Write a paragraph tracing his character arc using evidence from at least three chapters.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Ch 1: scared boy at an inn. Ch 11: brave enough to report mutiny. Ch 20+: independent. Ch 34: mature enough to reflect.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Silver escapes without real punishment. Is that satisfying? Or should he have been caught? Defend your opinion.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Some think it’s realistic. Others think villains should face consequences. What do YOU think?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Compare the endings of Wizard of Oz and Treasure Island. Dorothy goes home happy. Jim goes home haunted. What do these different endings tell us about these different kinds of stories?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: One is a fairy tale. The other is an adventure novel. Different genres, different truths about the world.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Special end-of-book journal (5-6 sentences!):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How did Treasure Island compare to Wizard of Oz as a reading experience?</li>
<li>What is the biggest difference between Jim at the beginning and Jim at the end?</li>
<li>What will you remember most about this book?</li>
</ul>
