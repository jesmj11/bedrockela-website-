<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>The group is growing! Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman are all headed to the Emerald City. But there’s one more friend to meet. This one might surprise you.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 6 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>Meet the last main character and think about what courage means</li>
<li>Look at the pattern of characters in this story</li>
<li>Write in your reading journal</li>
<li>Celebrate — you’ve finished your first week!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>So far, every new character is missing something: Dorothy (home), Scarecrow (brain), Tin Woodman (heart). The author is building a pattern. Let’s see if it continues.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: What does it mean to be brave? Is someone brave only if they’re never scared? Or can you be brave AND scared at the same time?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for while you read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Who is the new character, and what does he want?</li>
<li>Does the pattern continue?</li>
<li>What does the Lion do that seems brave, even though he says he’s not?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 6: The Cowardly Lion</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 6: “The Cowardly Lion.”</p>
<br>
<p>This chapter is fun because the Lion is not what you’d expect. Pay attention to the contradiction: he’s a big, powerful lion who says he’s afraid of everything.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Notice how each character in Dorothy’s group wants something they think they don’t have. The author is doing this on purpose. Ask yourself: why?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>courage  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>The ability to do something even when you’re afraid. Being brave even when it’s hard.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: “The Lion says he has no courage, and yet he leaps out to frighten the travelers — which takes courage in itself.”</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Can someone who says they have no courage actually be brave? What’s the difference between courage and not being afraid at all?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What does the Cowardly Lion want from the Wizard?</div>
<p>A) A brain</p>
<p>B) A heart</p>
<p>C) Courage</p>
<p>D) A way to fly</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is the pattern the author has created with the main characters?</div>
<p>A) They are all from Kansas</p>
<p>B) They each want something they think they don’t have</p>
<p>C) They are all afraid of the Wizard</p>
<p>D) They all want to stay in Oz forever</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. What does Dorothy do when the Lion tries to bite Toto?</div>
<p>A) She runs away</p>
<p>B) She cries</p>
<p>C) She slaps the Lion on his nose and calls him a coward</p>
<p>D) She asks the Scarecrow for help</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Dorothy slaps a lion on the nose to protect her dog. What character trait does that show? Do you think Dorothy knows she has this trait?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what it takes to stand up to something much bigger and stronger than you.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. We’ve now met all four main characters. Each one wants something: home, a brain, a heart, courage. Do you notice anything interesting about whether they already have the thing they want? Explain.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what each character has DONE so far. Do their actions match what they say they’re missing?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>End-of-week journal entry (3-4 sentences today!):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You’ve now met all four main characters. Who is your favorite and why?</li>
<li>Do you think the Lion is really a coward? Use an example from the chapter.</li>
<li>All four characters want something. Do you think the Wizard will give them what they want? What do you predict?</li>
</ul>
<br>
