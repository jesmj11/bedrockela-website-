<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Buck has arrived in the Yukon. Everything is different: the cold, the snow, the violence. Today Buck learns that this new world has only one rule — survive or die.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 2 of The Call of the Wild</li>
<li>Analyze how setting shapes character</li>
<li>Track Buck’s transformation</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>In Oz, the settings were colorful and magical. In Treasure Island, the ship was tense but civilized. The Yukon in The Call of the Wild is something else entirely: it is a place where nature does not care about you. There are no good witches, no friendly doctors. There is only cold, hunger, and the law of survival.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: If you were suddenly dropped into a harsh environment with no preparation, what would you need to learn to survive?</p>
<br>
<p>What to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does Buck learn in this chapter?</li>
<li>How does the setting (the Yukon) force Buck to change?</li>
<li>What is the law of club and fang?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read Chapter 2: The Law of Club and Fang.</p>
<br>
<p>Buck sees another dog killed for being weak. He learns to eat fast, steal food, sleep in the snow, and fight. The comfortable California dog is disappearing. Something older and wilder is waking up inside him.</p>
<br>
<div class="reading-tip">Reading tip: Jack London uses setting as a FORCE in this story. The Yukon is not just a backdrop — it is almost a character itself, shaping everything Buck becomes.</div>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>adversity  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>Difficult or challenging circumstances. Hardship that tests your strength and forces you to adapt.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Buck faces extreme adversity in the Yukon — cold, violence, starvation. But adversity is also what makes him stronger.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Can adversity make someone (or an animal) stronger? Or does it only cause harm? Think about Buck and about characters from earlier books.</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What is the law of club and fang?</div>
<p>A) A set of written rules posted at camp</p>
<p>B) The unwritten rule of survival: obey the strong or be destroyed</p>
<p>C) A game the dogs play</p>
<p>D) A law passed by the government</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How does the setting of the Yukon FORCE Buck to change?</div>
<p>A) It does not affect him</p>
<p>B) The extreme cold, violence, and competition for food force Buck to become tougher, smarter, and more aggressive</p>
<p>C) It makes him friendlier</p>
<p>D) It makes him want to go home more</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. How is the Yukon as a setting different from the settings in Oz and Treasure Island?</div>
<p>A) They are all the same</p>
<p>B) The Yukon is indifferent and deadly — nature does not care about Buck. Oz was magical and Treasure Island had human villains.</p>
<p>C) The Yukon is friendlier</p>
<p>D) There is no setting in Call of the Wild</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Buck is changing. He was a pampered pet; now he is learning to survive. Track his transformation so far: what has he lost? What is he gaining?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: He is losing comfort, safety, and trust. He is gaining strength, instincts, and toughness. Is this a good trade?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. In all three novels, the setting shapes the character. Dorothy was shaped by Oz, Jim was shaped by the ship and island, Buck is being shaped by the Yukon. Compare how setting works as a force in TWO of these books.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what the setting DEMANDS of the character. Oz demanded courage. The ship demanded trust and suspicion. The Yukon demands survival.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does the Yukon setting force Buck to change? Use specific details from the chapter.</li>
<li>Compare the Yukon to the settings in Oz or Treasure Island. How does each setting shape its character?</li>
<li>Do you think adversity is making Buck stronger or just hurting him? Defend your answer.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: When you write about setting, describe it with sensory details: What would you SEE, HEAR, FEEL in the Yukon?</h4>
