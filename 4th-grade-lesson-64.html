        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Buck and Spitz have been circling each other for chapters. Spitz is the lead dog — smart, experienced, ruthless. Buck is the newcomer — bigger, stronger, and getting wilder every day. Today, they fight.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Finish Chapter 3 (the fight between Buck and Spitz)</li>
<li>Analyze conflict: character vs. character AND character vs. nature</li>
<li>Think about what leadership and dominance mean in the wild</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Stories have different TYPES of conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character vs. Character (Buck vs. Spitz)</li>
<li>Character vs. Nature (Buck vs. the Yukon)</li>
<li>Character vs. Self (Buck vs. his own civilized instincts)</li>
<li>Character vs. Society (Buck vs. the humans who control him)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The Call of the Wild has ALL of these. Today, character vs. character takes center stage.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: In nature, leadership is determined by strength and intelligence. In human society, it is more complicated. Which system is more fair?</p>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Finish Chapter 3 if you have not already, focusing on the confrontation between Buck and Spitz.</p>
<br>
<p>This fight is the climax of Buck’s early transformation. After this, Buck is no longer a pet learning to survive. He is a leader.</p>
<br>
<div class="reading-tip">Reading tip: London describes animal conflict without making it cartoonish. It is violent and real. Pay attention to the strategy both dogs use — this is not mindless fighting. It is intelligent combat.</div>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>dominance  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>Power and control over others. In nature, dominance determines who leads, who eats first, and who survives.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Buck’s fight with Spitz is a fight for dominance — the winner becomes the leader of the pack.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is dominance the same as leadership? Can someone be dominant without being a good leader?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. Why do Buck and Spitz fight?</div>
<p>A) They are playing</p>
<p>B) They are competing for dominance — only one can be the lead dog</p>
<p>C) The humans make them fight</p>
<p>D) They are fighting over food</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What types of conflict does The Call of the Wild contain?</div>
<p>A) Only character vs. character</p>
<p>B) Character vs. character, character vs. nature, character vs. self, and character vs. society</p>
<p>C) No conflict</p>
<p>D) Only character vs. nature</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. The fight between Buck and Spitz is not just physical — it is also strategic. Find one moment where Buck uses intelligence, not just strength. What does this tell you about what kind of leader Buck will be?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Great leaders in nature use both strength AND cunning. Sound like anyone from Treasure Island?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Compare Buck’s rise to dominance with a character from an earlier book. How does Buck’s path to leadership compare to Dorothy’s or Jim’s growth? What is similar? What is different?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Dorothy grew through compassion. Jim grew through bravery. Buck grows through raw power and instinct. Different paths, different worlds.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Describe the fight between Buck and Spitz. What made Buck the winner — strength, intelligence, or both?</li>
<li>Compare Buck’s leadership to leadership you have seen in earlier books.</li>
<li>Is the law of the wild (the strongest leads) fair? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: You are now tracking multiple types of conflict in a single book. That is advanced reading analysis!</h4>

<h4>🌟  You’re Done!</h4>
<p>Great work today!</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Read the Buck vs. Spitz confrontation!</h4>
<h4>✅  Analyzed multiple types of conflict</h4>
<h4>✅  Compared leadership across novels</h4>
<h4>✅  Learned a new vocabulary word (dominance)</h4>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow, Buck is the new lead dog. But does power change him? And what does London’s writing tell us about the nature of survival? End of Week 13!</p>
<br>
<p>See you next lesson, reader. ⚓</p>
