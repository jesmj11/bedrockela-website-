<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Buck is the lead dog now. He has won through strength and intelligence. But what does leadership look like in the wild? And is Buck becoming more free — or more trapped?</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 4 of The Call of the Wild</li>
<li>Analyze Buck as a leader</li>
<li>Explore London’s use of imagery and figurative language</li>
<li>Write your end-of-week journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Buck has gone from pampered pet to sled dog to pack leader in four chapters. That is a massive character arc. Today, watch how Buck leads — and how London’s writing gets more poetic as Buck gets more wild.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: When you gain power, does it change who you are? Does leadership reveal your true nature or create a new one?</p>
<br>
<p>What to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does Buck lead the team? Is he a good leader?</li>
<li>How does London’s writing style match Buck’s transformation?</li>
<li>What imagery stands out to you?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read Chapter 4: Who Has Won to Mastership.</p>
<br>
<p>Buck thrives as the lead dog. London’s language becomes more powerful and poetic as Buck connects more deeply with the wild. Watch for figurative language — metaphors and similes that compare Buck to something greater.</p>
<br>
<div class="reading-tip">Reading tip: FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE is when an author uses comparisons to create vivid images. A simile uses like or as: Buck ran like a ghost through the snow. A metaphor says something IS something else: Buck was a king of the trail. London is full of both.</div>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>mastership  (noun)</strong></div>
<p>Complete skill and control. The state of being a master — having total command over something.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Buck has won to mastership — he is no longer just surviving. He is thriving, leading, commanding.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: What is the difference between surviving and achieving mastership? Buck has gone beyond survival. What has he become?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. How does Buck lead the dog team?</div>
<p>A) Through fear alone</p>
<p>B) Through a combination of strength, intelligence, and earned respect</p>
<p>C) He lets someone else lead</p>
<p>D) He is lazy and does not lead well</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What is figurative language?</div>
<p>A) Language about numbers and figures</p>
<p>B) Comparisons and imagery that create vivid pictures — similes, metaphors, personification</p>
<p>C) Dialogue between characters</p>
<p>D) Factual descriptions with no comparisons</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Which is an example of a simile?</div>
<p>A) Buck was the leader.</p>
<p>B) Buck ran like a shadow across the frozen lake.</p>
<p>C) The snow fell.</p>
<p>D) Buck ate his food.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Find one example of figurative language (simile or metaphor) from Chapter 4. Write it down and explain what it means and why it is effective.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Look for comparisons. London often compares Buck to wild things — ghosts, shadows, ancient beasts.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Buck has now completed a major transformation: pet to survivor to leader. Write a paragraph tracking this arc across Chapters 1-4. How has each chapter changed him?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Ch 1: stolen from home. Ch 2: learning survival. Ch 3: ancient instincts + defeating Spitz. Ch 4: mastery and leadership.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>End-of-week journal (paragraph — 5-6 sentences!):</p>

<li>Track Buck’s transformation from Chapter 1 to Chapter 4. How has he changed?</li>
<li>Find your favorite piece of figurative language from this week’s reading. Why does it work?</li>
<li>Compare Buck’s character arc so far to Dorothy’s or Jim’s. How are their transformations similar and different?</li>
