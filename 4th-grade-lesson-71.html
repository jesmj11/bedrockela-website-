        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Mowgli’s story reaches its turning point. He must face Shere Khan the tiger — and in doing so, he discovers that he does not fully belong in either the jungle OR the human village. Sound familiar? Buck felt the same pull between two worlds.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Tiger! Tiger! from The Jungle Book</li>
<li>Track Mowgli’s identity crisis: human or jungle creature?</li>
<li>Compare Mowgli’s turning point to Buck’s</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Mowgli goes to the human village and discovers he does not fit in there either. He is too wild for the humans, too human for the animals. This is the heart of his story: belonging nowhere and everywhere at once.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Have you ever felt like you did not fully belong in two different groups? Like you were caught between two worlds?</p>
<br>
<p>What to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do the villagers treat Mowgli?</li>
<li>How does Mowgli defeat Shere Khan?</li>
<li>After the victory, does Mowgli belong with the humans or the animals?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read Tiger! Tiger! from The Jungle Book. Mowgli goes to the human village, learns to live among people, but is ultimately rejected. He lures Shere Khan into a trap and destroys his enemy — but the villagers turn on him too.</p>
<br>
<div class="reading-tip">Reading tip: This story has a bittersweet ending. Mowgli wins the battle but loses his place in both worlds. Pay attention to how Kipling handles this — it is NOT a simple happy ending.</div>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<p>exile  (noun/verb)</p>
<p>Being forced to leave your home or community. Living away from where you belong, often against your will.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Mowgli becomes an exile from both worlds — cast out by the village and drifting from the jungle. He belongs to himself alone.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Is exile always punishment? Or can it be a kind of freedom? Compare Mowgli’s exile to Buck’s choice to leave the human world.</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. Why do the villagers turn against Mowgli?</div>
<p>A) He steals from them</p>
<p>B) They fear him because of his connection to the jungle and the wolves</p>
<p>C) He attacks them</p>
<p>D) He refuses to work</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How does Mowgli defeat Shere Khan?</div>
<p>A) He fights the tiger alone with his bare hands</p>
<p>B) He uses his intelligence to lure Shere Khan into a stampede</p>
<p>C) The wolves defeat Shere Khan for him</p>
<p>D) He uses a gun from the village</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. After defeating Shere Khan, where does Mowgli belong?</div>
<p>A) He is welcomed back to the village as a hero</p>
<p>B) He is caught between worlds — rejected by the village and not fully part of the jungle</p>
<p>C) He becomes king of the jungle</p>
<p>D) He returns to his birth parents</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Compare Mowgli’s turning point to Buck’s. Buck chose the wild after Thornton died. Mowgli is pushed out of the human world. How are these moments similar and different? Which character has more control over their fate?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Buck’s departure feels triumphant. Mowgli’s feels more painful. Why?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Mowgli uses HUMAN intelligence (planning, strategy) to defeat a JUNGLE enemy (Shere Khan). What does this tell you about Mowgli’s unique power — being BOTH human and wild?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Mowgli’s strength comes from being between two worlds. He can think like a human and act like an animal.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Journal entry (paragraph):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Mowgli belongs to neither world fully. Is that tragic, or is it a kind of superpower?</li>
<li>Compare Buck’s final choice to Mowgli’s situation. Who is more free?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt caught between two groups or two identities? How does Mowgli’s story connect to real life?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: The best literature connects to YOUR life. When you see yourself in a character, the story becomes more than just words on a page.</h4>
