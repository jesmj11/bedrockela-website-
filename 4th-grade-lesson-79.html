            <p class="meta">The Jungle Book • Mowgli’s final story: Spring Running (or Letting In the Jungle)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-content">
<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>Mowgli’s story reaches its emotional conclusion. Just as Buck felt the pull of the wild, Mowgli feels a pull toward the human world. Spring is coming to the jungle, and something in Mowgli is changing.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Mowgli’s final Jungle Book story</li>
<li>Analyze Mowgli’s final choice</li>
<li>Compare Buck’s and Mowgli’s endings</li>
<li>Write in your journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>Buck’s ending: He answers the call of the wild and becomes fully animal, running with wolves forever.</p>
<p>Mowgli’s ending: He feels the pull of the human world and must eventually leave the jungle.</p>
<br>
<p>OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. Same ache. Same impossible choice.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Is it harder to leave a place you love because something is pulling you away, or because you have outgrown it?</p>
<br>
<p>What to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is changing inside Mowgli?</li>
<li>How do the jungle animals react to Mowgli’s change?</li>
<li>Does Mowgli want to leave, or does he feel he must?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Today’s Task</h3>
<p>Read the final Mowgli story (Spring Running or Letting In the Jungle, depending on your edition).</p>
<br>
<p>Mowgli feels restless. The spring makes him emotional in ways he cannot explain. He is growing up — and growing up means growing away from the jungle.</p>
<br>
<div class="reading-tip">Reading tip: This ending is quieter than Buck’s. There is no dramatic event that forces Mowgli’s hand. Instead, it is an internal shift — a slow realization that he belongs somewhere else. Sometimes the quietest moments are the most powerful.</div>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>inevitable  (adjective)</strong></div>
<p>Certain to happen. Unavoidable. Something that was always going to occur, no matter what.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: Mowgli’s departure from the jungle feels inevitable. He was always human, even when he lived as an animal. Sooner or later, his human nature was going to win.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Was Buck’s transformation also inevitable? Were both characters always destined to become what they became?</p>
<br>
<h4>✅  Check Your Understanding</h4>
<p>Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. Why does Mowgli begin to feel different in the spring?</div>
<p>A) He is sick</p>
<p>B) He is growing up and feeling the pull of his human nature</p>
<p>C) The animals kick him out</p>
<p>D) He finds a map to the village</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. How is Mowgli’s ending different from Buck’s?</div>
<p>A) They are the same</p>
<p>B) Buck runs toward the wild with triumph; Mowgli walks toward civilization with sadness and necessity</p>
<p>C) Mowgli becomes a wolf</p>
<p>D) Buck goes to a village</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Compare Buck’s ending to Mowgli’s. Buck GAINS something by answering the wild. Does Mowgli gain or lose by leaving the jungle? Can it be both?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Buck’s ending feels triumphant. Mowgli’s feels bittersweet. Why does the same theme produce such different emotions?</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. Both endings are about IDENTITY: who am I really? Buck discovers he is wild at his core. Mowgli discovers he is human at his core. Write a paragraph comparing how each character answers the question Where do I belong?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: This is the deepest comparison in the unit. Take your time with it.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>✍️  Your Reading Journal</h4>
<p>Journal entry (5-6 sentences):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Compare the endings of Call of the Wild and Jungle Book. Which affected you more and why?</li>
<li>Both characters answer the question Who am I? Compare their answers.</li>
<li>What is the ultimate message about nature vs. civilization when you read BOTH books together?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: You have now completed BOTH books in the unit. Your comparison skills are extraordinary.</h4>
