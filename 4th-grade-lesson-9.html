<h4>📚  Welcome!</h4>
<p>This is it. Dorothy and her friends finally get to meet the Wizard. But here’s the thing about the Wizard of Oz — he’s not exactly what anyone expected. Pay very close attention today.</p>
<br>
<p>Today you will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 11 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>Notice how the Wizard appears differently to each character</li>
<li>Make predictions about what’s really going on</li>
<li>Write in your reading journal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Time: About 45-50 minutes</p>
<br>
<h3>🧐  Part 1: Before You Read</h3>
<p>We’ve been hearing about the “great and powerful Oz” since Chapter 2. Every character is hoping the Wizard can give them what they’re missing. But remember the theme we’ve been tracking: things aren’t always what they seem.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about this: Have you ever been really excited to meet someone or go somewhere, and then it wasn’t what you expected? What happened?</p>
<br>
<h4>🔍 What to look for while you read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Wizard looks different to each person who visits him. What does he look like each time?</li>
<li>Does the Wizard agree to help them right away?</li>
<li>What does the Wizard want in return?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 11: The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz</h3>
<p>Open your digital copy and read Chapter 11: “The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz.”</p>
<br>
<p>This is a really important chapter. The Wizard appears in four different forms to four different characters. Keep track of what form he takes each time.</p>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reading tip: Ask yourself — if the Wizard looks different every time, what does that tell you about him? Is he hiding something?</h4>
<br>
<h3>💬  Part 3: Word of the Day</h3>
<div class="vocab-box"><strong>terrible  (adjective)</strong></div>
<p>In this book, “terrible” means “causing fear or awe” — not just “bad.” The Wizard is called “The Great and Terrible” because he is powerful and frightening.</p>
<br>
<p>From the story: “Oz, the Great and Terrible” — the name is meant to make people afraid and impressed at the same time.</p>
<br>
<p>Think about it: Why would someone want to be called “terrible”? What’s the advantage of making people afraid of you?</p>
<br>
<h3>✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding</h3>
<p>Answer these questions using what you read.</p>
<br>
<div class="question">1. What does the Wizard look like when Dorothy sees him?</div>
<p>A) A beautiful fairy</p>
<p>B) A giant floating head</p>
<p>C) A friendly old man</p>
<p>D) A ball of fire</p>
<br>
<div class="question">2. What does the Wizard tell Dorothy she must do before he will help her?</div>
<p>A) Find the silver shoes</p>
<p>B) Kill the Wicked Witch of the West</p>
<p>C) Bring him a golden crown</p>
<p>D) Walk around the Emerald City three times</p>
<br>
<div class="question">3. Why is it suspicious that the Wizard looks different to each visitor?</div>
<p>A) Wizards always change their appearance</p>
<p>B) It suggests he might be using tricks and isn’t what he seems</p>
<p>C) It means he is very powerful</p>
<p>D) It is completely normal in Oz</p>
<br>
<div class="question">4. The Wizard appears as a giant head to Dorothy, a beautiful fairy to the Scarecrow, a terrible beast to the Tin Woodman, and a ball of fire to the Lion. Why do you think he shows a different form to each one? What might he be doing?</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Think about what would be most impressive or scary to each character.</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<div class="question">5. Make a prediction: Do you think the Wizard is truly great and powerful, or is something else going on? Explain your thinking using at least one clue from the story.</div>
<h4>💡 Hint: Remember the green glasses, the different forms, and the theme of “things aren’t what they seem.”</h4>
<p>[Your answer]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal</h3>
<p>Today’s journal entry (2-3 sentences):</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Do you trust the Wizard? Why or why not?</li>
<li>If you were Dorothy, how would you feel about being told to kill a witch?</li>
<li>Make a prediction about what will happen with the Wicked Witch of the West.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>💡 Reminder: When you make a prediction, try to explain WHY you think it will happen. “I think ___ will happen because...”</h4>
