      "text": "MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington\r\nGardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one of the\r\nmost noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to\r\navoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little\r\nwas known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said\r\nthat he resembled Byron—at least that his head was Byronic; but he was\r\na bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without\r\ngrowing old.\r\n\r\nCertainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was\r\na Londoner. He was never seen on ’Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the\r\ncounting-rooms of the “City”; no ships ever came into London docks of\r\nwhich he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been\r\nentered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln’s\r\nInn, or Gray’s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of\r\nChancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen’s Bench, or the\r\nEcclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he\r\na merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the\r\nscientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part\r\nin the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London\r\nInstitution, the Artisan’s Association, or the Institution of Arts and\r\nSciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which\r\nswarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the\r\nEntomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\r\n\r\nThe way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nHe was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His\r\ncheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which\r\nwas always flush.\r\n\r\nWas Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could\r\nnot imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last\r\nperson to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on\r\nthe contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed\r\nfor a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and\r\nsometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of\r\nmen. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his\r\ntaciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but\r\nwhatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done\r\nbefore, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.\r\n\r\nHad he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world\r\nmore familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear\r\nto have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a\r\nfew clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the\r\nclub as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true\r\nprobabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so\r\noften did events justify his predictions. He must have travelled\r\neverywhere, at least in the spirit.\r\n\r\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from\r\nLondon for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance\r\nwith him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever\r\nseen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and\r\nplaying whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one,\r\nharmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse,\r\nbeing reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to\r\nwin, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a\r\nstruggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle,\r\ncongenial to his tastes.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may\r\nhappen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,\r\nwhich is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his house in Saville\r\nRow, whither none penetrated. A single domestic sufficed to serve him.\r\nHe breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in\r\nthe same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other\r\nmembers, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly\r\nmidnight, only to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy\r\nchambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed\r\nten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or\r\nmaking his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular\r\nstep in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular\r\ngallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns,\r\nand illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all\r\nthe resources of the club—its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and\r\ndairy—aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was\r\nserved by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin\r\nsoles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest\r\nlinen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port,\r\nand his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly\r\ncooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\r\n\r\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that\r\nthere is something good in eccentricity.\r\n\r\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly\r\ncomfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but\r\nlittle from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be\r\nalmost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he\r\nhad dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought\r\nhim shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of\r\neighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house\r\nbetween eleven and half-past.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close\r\ntogether like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his\r\nknees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a\r\ncomplicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,\r\nthe days, the months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr.\r\nFogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair\r\nto the Reform.\r\n\r\nA rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where\r\nPhileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“The new servant,” said he.\r\n\r\nA young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\r\n\r\n“You are a Frenchman, I believe,” asked Phileas Fogg, “and your name is\r\nJohn?”\r\n\r\n“Jean, if monsieur pleases,” replied the newcomer, “Jean Passepartout,\r\na surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for\r\ngoing out of one business into another. I believe I’m honest, monsieur,\r\nbut, to be outspoken, I’ve had several trades. I’ve been an itinerant\r\nsinger, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on\r\na rope like Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as\r\nto make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at\r\nParis, and assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years\r\nago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as\r\na valet here in England. Finding myself out of place, and hearing that\r\nMonsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him\r\na tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout.”\r\n\r\n“Passepartout suits me,” responded Mr. Fogg. “You are well recommended\r\nto me; I hear a good report of you. You know my conditions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Good! What time is it?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-two minutes after eleven,” returned Passepartout, drawing an\r\nenormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\r\n\r\n“You are too slow,” said Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible—”\r\n\r\n“You are four minutes too slow. No matter; it’s enough to mention the\r\nerror. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m.,\r\nthis Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head\r\nwith an automatic motion, and went off without a word.\r\n\r\nPassepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master\r\ngoing out. He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James\r\nForster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone in the\r\nhouse in Saville Row."
