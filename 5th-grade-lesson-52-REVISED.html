      "title": "Chapter 2: IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND HIS IDEAL",
      "text": "“Faith,” muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, “I’ve seen people at\r\nMadame Tussaud’s as lively as my new master!”\r\n\r\nMadame Tussaud’s “people,” let it be said, are of wax, and are much\r\nvisited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.\r\n\r\nDuring his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been\r\ncarefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty years of\r\nage, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his\r\nhair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his\r\nface rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in\r\nthe highest degree what physiognomists call “repose in action,” a\r\nquality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a\r\nclear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure\r\nwhich Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen\r\nin the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being\r\nperfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer.\r\nPhileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed\r\neven in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well\r\nas in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\r\n\r\nHe was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was\r\neconomical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step\r\ntoo many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he\r\nmade no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or\r\nagitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always\r\nreached his destination at the exact moment.\r\n\r\nHe lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and\r\nas he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and\r\nthat friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\r\n\r\nAs for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had\r\nabandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he\r\nhad in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was\r\nby no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Molière with a bold\r\ngaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a\r\npleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable,\r\nwith a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a\r\nfriend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost\r\nportly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully\r\ndeveloped by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was\r\nsomewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have\r\nknown eighteen methods of arranging Minerva’s tresses, Passepartout was\r\nfamiliar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a\r\nlarge-tooth comb completed his toilet.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash to predict how Passepartout’s lively nature would\r\nagree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant\r\nwould turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;\r\nexperience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort\r\nof vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far\r\nhe had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English\r\nhouses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he\r\nfound his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly\r\nrunning about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last\r\nmaster, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his\r\nnights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the\r\nmorning on policemen’s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting\r\nthe gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such\r\nconduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr.\r\nPhileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of\r\nunbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home\r\novernight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He\r\npresented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the\r\nhouse in Saville Row. He began its inspection without delay, scouring\r\nit from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion\r\npleased him; it seemed to him like a snail’s shell, lighted and warmed\r\nby gas, which sufficed for both these purposes. When Passepartout\r\nreached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to\r\ninhabit, and he was well satisfied with it. Electric bells and\r\nspeaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on\r\nthe mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg’s\r\nbedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant. “That’s\r\ngood, that’ll do,” said Passepartout to himself.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon\r\ninspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house.\r\nIt comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the\r\nmorning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past\r\neleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club—all the details of\r\nservice, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the\r\nshaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at\r\ntwenty minutes before ten. Everything was regulated and foreseen that\r\nwas to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at\r\nwhich the methodical gentleman retired.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg’s wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair\r\nof trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year\r\nand season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and\r\nthe same system was applied to the master’s shoes. In short, the house\r\nin Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder and\r\nunrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,\r\ncomfort, and method idealised. There was no study, nor were there\r\nbooks, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the\r\nReform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law\r\nand politics, were at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his\r\nbedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but\r\nPassepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;\r\neverything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\r\n\r\nHaving scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a\r\nbroad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, “This is\r\njust what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I! What\r\na domestic and regular gentleman! A real machine; well, I don’t mind\r\nserving a machine.”"
