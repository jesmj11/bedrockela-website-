      "title": "Chapter 4: IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT, HIS SERVANT",
      "text": "Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his friends,\r\nPhileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left the Reform Club.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, who had conscientiously studied the programme of his\r\nduties, was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the\r\ninexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for, according to\r\nrule, he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom, and called out, “Passepartout!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout did not reply. It could not be he who was called; it was\r\nnot the right hour.\r\n\r\n“Passepartout!” repeated Mr. Fogg, without raising his voice.\r\n\r\nPassepartout made his appearance.\r\n\r\n“I’ve called you twice,” observed his master.\r\n\r\n“But it is not midnight,” responded the other, showing his watch.\r\n\r\n“I know it; I don’t blame you. We start for Dover and Calais in ten\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nA puzzled grin overspread Passepartout’s round face; clearly he had not\r\ncomprehended his master.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is going to leave home?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Phileas Fogg. “We are going round the world.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his\r\nhands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“Round the world!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“In eighty days,” responded Mr. Fogg. “So we haven’t a moment to lose.”\r\n\r\n“But the trunks?” gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head\r\nfrom right to left.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three\r\npairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We’ll buy our clothes\r\non the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, and some\r\nstout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout tried to reply, but could not. He went out, mounted to his\r\nown room, fell into a chair, and muttered: “That’s good, that is! And\r\nI, who wanted to remain quiet!”\r\n\r\nHe mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around\r\nthe world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke,\r\nthen? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all,\r\nPassepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be\r\nsorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as\r\nfar as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But\r\nsurely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no\r\ndoubt—but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this\r\nso domestic person hitherto!\r\n\r\nBy eight o’clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag,\r\ncontaining the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still\r\ntroubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended\r\nto Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg was quite ready. Under his arm might have been observed a\r\nred-bound copy of Bradshaw’s Continental Railway Steam Transit and\r\nGeneral Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of\r\nsteamers and railways. He took the carpet-bag, opened it, and slipped\r\ninto it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes, which would pass\r\nwherever he might go.\r\n\r\n“You have forgotten nothing?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“My mackintosh and cloak?”\r\n\r\n“Here they are.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Take this carpet-bag,” handing it to Passepartout. “Take good\r\ncare of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout nearly dropped the bag, as if the twenty thousand pounds\r\nwere in gold, and weighed him down.\r\n\r\nMaster and man then descended, the street-door was double-locked, and\r\nat the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing\r\nCross. The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes\r\npast eight. Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master,\r\nwho, after paying the cabman, was about to enter the station, when a\r\npoor beggar-woman, with a child in her arms, her naked feet smeared\r\nwith mud, her head covered with a wretched bonnet, from which hung a\r\ntattered feather, and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl,\r\napproached, and mournfully asked for alms.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist, and\r\nhanded them to the beggar, saying, “Here, my good woman. I’m glad that\r\nI met you;” and passed on.\r\n\r\nPassepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his master’s action\r\ntouched his susceptible heart.\r\n\r\nTwo first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased, Mr.\r\nFogg was crossing the station to the train, when he perceived his five\r\nfriends of the Reform.\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen,” said he, “I’m off, you see; and, if you will examine\r\nmy passport when I get back, you will be able to judge whether I have\r\naccomplished the journey agreed upon.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg,” said Ralph politely.\r\n“We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour.”\r\n\r\n“You do not forget when you are due in London again?” asked Stuart.\r\n\r\n“In eighty days; on Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872, at a quarter\r\nbefore nine p.m. Good-bye, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class\r\ncarriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle\r\nscreamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling. Phileas Fogg,\r\nsnugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips. Passepartout,\r\nnot yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the\r\ncarpet-bag, with its enormous treasure.\r\n\r\nJust as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout suddenly\r\nuttered a cry of despair.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“Alas! In my hurry—I—I forgot—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“To turn off the gas in my room!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, young man,” returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; “it will burn—at\r\nyour expense.”"
