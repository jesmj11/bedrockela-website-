      "text": "’CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would\r\ncreate a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread\r\nthrough the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation\r\nto its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout\r\nEngland. The boasted “tour of the world” was talked about, disputed,\r\nargued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama\r\nclaim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook\r\ntheir heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they\r\ndeclared, that the tour of the world could be made, except\r\ntheoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the\r\nexisting means of travelling. The _Times, Standard, Morning Post_, and\r\n_Daily News_, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted\r\nMr. Fogg’s project as madness; the _Daily Telegraph_ alone hesitatingly\r\nsupported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his\r\nReform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the\r\nmental aberration of its proposer.\r\n\r\nArticles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for\r\ngeography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns\r\ndevoted to Phileas Fogg’s venture were eagerly devoured by all classes\r\nof readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler\r\nsex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ came out with his portrait, copied from a\r\nphotograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the _Daily Telegraph_\r\neven dared to say, “Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nAt last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin\r\nof the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from\r\nevery point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nEverything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed\r\nalike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of\r\ndeparture and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary\r\nto his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at\r\nthe designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively\r\nmoderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and\r\nthe United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon\r\naccomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, the\r\nliability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the\r\nblocking up by snow—were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he\r\nnot find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of\r\nthe winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be\r\ntwo or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to\r\nfatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once\r\nmiss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next,\r\nand that would irrevocably render his attempt vain.\r\n\r\nThis article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the\r\npapers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are of a\r\nhigher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament.\r\nNot only the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy\r\nwagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting\r\nbooks as if he were a race-horse. Bonds were issued, and made their\r\nappearance on ’Change; “Phileas Fogg bonds” were offered at par or at a\r\npremium, and a great business was done in them. But five days after the\r\narticle in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the\r\ndemand began to subside: “Phileas Fogg” declined. They were offered by\r\npackages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody would\r\ntake less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!\r\n\r\nLord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only\r\nadvocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was fastened to his\r\nchair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the\r\nworld, if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas\r\nFogg. When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was\r\npointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, “If the thing\r\nis feasible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman.”\r\n\r\nThe Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him,\r\nand the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a\r\nweek after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of\r\nbackers at any price.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o’clock\r\none evening, when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his\r\nhands:\r\n\r\n_Suez to London._\r\n\r\n\r\nROWAN, COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, SCOTLAND YARD:\r\n    I’ve found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg. Send without delay\r\n    warrant of arrest to Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIX, _Detective_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of this dispatch was instantaneous. The polished gentleman\r\ndisappeared to give place to the bank robber. His photograph, which was\r\nhung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club, was\r\nminutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, the description\r\nof the robber which had been provided to the police. The mysterious\r\nhabits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden\r\ndeparture; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the\r\nworld on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than\r\nto elude the detectives, and throw them off his track."
