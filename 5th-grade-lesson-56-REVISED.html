      "text": "Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about on\r\nthe quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was obliged not to\r\nsee anything.\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend,” said the detective, coming up with him, “is your\r\npassport _visaed?_”\r\n\r\n“Ah, it’s you, is it, monsieur?” responded Passepartout. “Thanks, yes,\r\nthe passport is all right.”\r\n\r\n“And you are looking about you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream. So\r\nthis is Suez?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In Egypt?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, in Egypt.”\r\n\r\n“And in Africa?”\r\n\r\n“In Africa.”\r\n\r\n“In Africa!” repeated Passepartout. “Just think, monsieur, I had no\r\nidea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris\r\nwas between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in\r\nthe morning, between the Northern and the Lyons stations, through the\r\nwindows of a car, and in a driving rain! How I regret not having seen\r\nonce more Père la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysées!”\r\n\r\n“You are in a great hurry, then?”\r\n\r\n“I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes and\r\nshirts. We came away without trunks, only with a carpet-bag.”\r\n\r\n“I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want.”\r\n\r\n“Really, monsieur, you are very kind.”\r\n\r\nAnd they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they\r\nwent along.\r\n\r\n“Above all,” said he; “don’t let me lose the steamer.”\r\n\r\n“You have plenty of time; it’s only twelve o’clock.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout pulled out his big watch. “Twelve!” he exclaimed; “why,\r\nit’s only eight minutes before ten.”\r\n\r\n“Your watch is slow.”\r\n\r\n“My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my\r\ngreat-grandfather! It doesn’t vary five minutes in the year. It’s a\r\nperfect chronometer, look you.”\r\n\r\n“I see how it is,” said Fix. “You have kept London time, which is two\r\nhours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch at noon in\r\neach country.”\r\n\r\n“I regulate my watch? Never!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, it will not agree with the sun.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!”\r\n\r\nAnd the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant\r\ngesture. After a few minutes silence, Fix resumed: “You left London\r\nhastily, then?”\r\n\r\n“I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o’clock in the evening,\r\nMonsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour\r\nafterwards we were off.”\r\n\r\n“But where is your master going?”\r\n\r\n“Always straight ahead. He is going round the world.”\r\n\r\n“Round the world?” cried Fix.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I\r\ndon’t believe a word of it. That wouldn’t be common sense. There’s\r\nsomething else in the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?”\r\n\r\n“I should say he was.”\r\n\r\n“Is he rich?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes\r\nwith him. And he doesn’t spare the money on the way, either: he has\r\noffered a large reward to the engineer of the ‘Mongolia’ if he gets us\r\nto Bombay well in advance of time.”\r\n\r\n“And you have known your master a long time?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited\r\ndetective may be imagined. The hasty departure from London soon after\r\nthe robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach\r\ndistant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet—all\r\nconfirmed Fix in his theory. He continued to pump poor Passepartout,\r\nand learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who\r\nlived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no\r\none knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in\r\nhis affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land\r\nat Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.\r\n\r\n“Is Bombay far from here?” asked Passepartout.\r\n\r\n“Pretty far. It is a ten days’ voyage by sea.”\r\n\r\n“And in what country is Bombay?”\r\n\r\n“India.”\r\n\r\n“In Asia?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce! I was going to tell you there’s one thing that worries\r\nme—my burner!”\r\n\r\n“What burner?”\r\n\r\n“My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment\r\nburning at my expense. I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two\r\nshillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I\r\nearn; and you will understand that the longer our journey—”\r\n\r\nDid Fix pay any attention to Passepartout’s trouble about the gas? It\r\nis not probable. He was not listening, but was cogitating a project.\r\nPassepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Fix left his\r\ncompanion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the\r\nsteamer, and hurried back to the consulate. Now that he was fully\r\nconvinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity.\r\n\r\n“Consul,” said he, “I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man.\r\nHe passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in\r\neighty days.”\r\n\r\n“Then he’s a sharp fellow,” returned the consul, “and counts on\r\nreturning to London after putting the police of the two countries off\r\nhis track.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see about that,” replied Fix.\r\n\r\n“But are you not mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“I am not mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the _visa_, that he had\r\npassed through Suez?”\r\n\r\n“Why? I have no idea; but listen to me.”\r\n\r\nHe reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation\r\nwith Passepartout.\r\n\r\n“In short,” said the consul, “appearances are wholly against this man.\r\nAnd what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched\r\ninstantly to Bombay, take passage on board the ‘Mongolia,’ follow my\r\nrogue to India, and there, on English ground, arrest him politely, with\r\nmy warrant in my hand, and my hand on his shoulder.”\r\n\r\nHaving uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective\r\ntook leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence\r\nhe sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office. A\r\nquarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand,\r\nproceeding on board the “Mongolia;” and, ere many moments longer, the\r\nnoble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea."
