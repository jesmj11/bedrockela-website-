      "text": "SHOES\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base\r\nin the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces\r\nfourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally\r\na population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls. The British\r\nCrown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of\r\nthis vast country, and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta,\r\ngovernors at Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor\r\nat Agra.\r\n\r\nBut British India, properly so called, only embraces seven hundred\r\nthousand square miles, and a population of from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and ten millions of inhabitants. A considerable portion of\r\nIndia is still free from British authority; and there are certain\r\nferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent. The\r\ncelebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756, when the\r\nEnglish first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city\r\nof Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection. It\r\ngradually annexed province after province, purchasing them of the\r\nnative chiefs, whom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor-general\r\nand his subordinates, civil and military. But the East India Company\r\nhas now passed away, leaving the British possessions in India directly\r\nunder the control of the Crown. The aspect of the country, as well as\r\nthe manners and distinctions of race, is daily changing.\r\n\r\nFormerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods\r\nof going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldy coaches;\r\nnow fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great\r\nrailway, with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its\r\nroute, traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days.\r\nThis railway does not run in a direct line across India. The distance\r\nbetween Bombay and Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one\r\nthousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road\r\nincrease this distance by more than a third.\r\n\r\nThe general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows:\r\nLeaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing to the continent\r\nopposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts, runs thence\r\nnorth-east as far as Burhampoor, skirts the nearly independent\r\nterritory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, turns thence eastwardly,\r\nmeeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs from the river a little,\r\nand, descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of\r\nChandernagor, has its terminus at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe passengers of the “Mongolia” went ashore at half-past four p.m.; at\r\nexactly eight the train would start for Calcutta.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg, after bidding good-bye to his whist partners, left the\r\nsteamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it upon him to\r\nbe at the station promptly at eight, and, with his regular step, which\r\nbeat to the second, like an astronomical clock, directed his steps to\r\nthe passport office. As for the wonders of Bombay—its famous city hall,\r\nits splendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques,\r\nsynagogues, its Armenian churches, and the noble pagoda on Malabar\r\nHill, with its two polygonal towers—he cared not a straw to see them.\r\nHe would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or\r\nthe mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks, or those\r\nfine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the\r\nisland of Salcette.\r\n\r\nHaving transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas Fogg\r\nrepaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner. Among\r\nthe dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a\r\ncertain giblet of “native rabbit,” on which he prided himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced sauce,\r\nfound it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, and, on his\r\nappearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, “Is this rabbit,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord,” the rogue boldly replied, “rabbit from the jungles.”\r\n\r\n“And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?”\r\n\r\n“Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you—”\r\n\r\n“Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats were\r\nformerly considered, in India, as sacred animals. That was a good\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“For the cats, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps for the travellers as well!”\r\n\r\nAfter which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner. Fix had gone on\r\nshore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his first destination was the\r\nheadquarters of the Bombay police. He made himself known as a London\r\ndetective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs\r\nrelative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had\r\narrived from London. It had not reached the office; indeed, there had\r\nnot yet been time for it to arrive. Fix was sorely disappointed, and\r\ntried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay\r\npolice. This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London\r\noffice, which alone could legally deliver the warrant. Fix did not\r\ninsist, and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the\r\nimportant document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the\r\nmysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay. He did not doubt for a\r\nmoment, any more than Passepartout, that Phileas Fogg would remain\r\nthere, at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master’s orders on\r\nleaving the “Mongolia” than he saw at once that they were to leave\r\nBombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey would be\r\nextended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond that place. He\r\nbegan to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not\r\nreally in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing\r\nhim, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!\r\n\r\nHaving purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a\r\nleisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many\r\nnationalities—Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round\r\nturbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and\r\nlong-robed Armenians—were collected. It happened to be the day of a\r\nParsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster—the most\r\nthrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among\r\nwhom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay—were\r\ncelebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows,\r\nin the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured\r\ngauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect\r\nmodesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is\r\nneedless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with\r\nstaring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the\r\ngreenest booby imaginable.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew him\r\nunconsciously farther off than he intended to go. At last, having seen\r\nthe Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps\r\ntowards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on\r\nMalabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its\r\ninterior. He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to\r\nenter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in\r\nwithout first leaving their shoes outside the door. It may be said here\r\nthat the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a\r\ndisregard of the practices of the native religions.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist,\r\nand was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation\r\nwhich everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself\r\nsprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged\r\npriests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to\r\nbeat him with loud, savage exclamations. The agile Frenchman was soon\r\nupon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his\r\nlong-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of\r\nhis toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could\r\ncarry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd\r\nin the streets.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and\r\nhaving in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed\r\nbreathlessly into the station.\r\n\r\nFix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was\r\nreally going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had\r\nresolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if\r\nnecessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an\r\nobscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words\r\nto Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“I hope that this will not happen again,” said Phileas Fogg coldly, as\r\nhe got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed\r\nhis master without a word. Fix was on the point of entering another\r\ncarriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll stay,” muttered he. “An offence has been committed on Indian\r\nsoil. I’ve got my man.”\r\n\r\nJust then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train passed out\r\ninto the darkness of the night."
