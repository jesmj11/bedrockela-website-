      "text": "FABULOUS PRICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train had started punctually. Among the passengers were a number of\r\nofficers, Government officials, and opium and indigo merchants, whose\r\nbusiness called them to the eastern coast. Passepartout rode in the\r\nsame carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a seat\r\nopposite to them. This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg’s\r\nwhist partners on the “Mongolia,” now on his way to join his corps at\r\nBenares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly\r\ndistinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt. He made India his home,\r\nonly paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost\r\nas familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character of\r\nIndia and its people. But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but\r\nonly describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these\r\nsubjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the\r\nterrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics. He was\r\nat this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since\r\nhis departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a\r\nuseless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction.\r\nSir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling\r\ncompanion—although the only opportunity he had for studying him had\r\nbeen while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers—and\r\nquestioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold\r\nexterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of\r\nnature. The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all\r\nthe eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to this\r\nproduct of the exact sciences.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going\r\nround the world, nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the\r\ngeneral only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of\r\nsound common sense. In the way this strange gentleman was going on, he\r\nwould leave the world without having done any good to himself or\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\nAn hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the\r\nIsland of Salcette, and had got into the open country. At Callyan they\r\nreached the junction of the branch line which descends towards\r\nsouth-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they\r\nentered the defiles of the mountains, with their basalt bases, and\r\ntheir summits crowned with thick and verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and\r\nSir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time, and now\r\nSir Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, “Some years ago, Mr.\r\nFogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which would\r\nprobably have lost you your wager.”\r\n\r\n“How so, Sir Francis?”\r\n\r\n“Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the\r\npassengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to\r\nKandallah, on the other side.”\r\n\r\n“Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least,” said Mr.\r\nFogg. “I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Fogg,” pursued Sir Francis, “you run the risk of having some\r\ndifficulty about this worthy fellow’s adventure at the pagoda.”\r\nPassepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket,\r\nwas sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him.\r\n“The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence. It takes\r\nparticular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be\r\nrespected, and if your servant were caught—”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Sir Francis,” replied Mr. Fogg; “if he had been caught he\r\nwould have been condemned and punished, and then would have quietly\r\nreturned to Europe. I don’t see how this affair could have delayed his\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation fell again. During the night the train left the\r\nmountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded over\r\nthe flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its straggling\r\nvillages, above which rose the minarets of the pagodas. This fertile\r\nterritory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams,\r\nmostly tributaries of the Godavery.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was\r\nactually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by\r\nan English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon\r\ncotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam\r\ncurled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which\r\nwere seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned\r\nmonasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless\r\nornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts\r\nextending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers,\r\nwhich fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated\r\nby the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive\r\neyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travellers crossed, beyond\r\nMilligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the\r\nsectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its\r\ngraceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious\r\nAureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the\r\nkingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee\r\nchief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by\r\na secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess\r\nDeath, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part\r\nof the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being\r\nfound in every direction. The English Government has succeeded in\r\ngreatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and\r\npursue the exercise of their horrible rites.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout\r\nwas able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false\r\npearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.\r\nThe travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur,\r\nafter skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which\r\nempties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat.\r\n\r\nPassepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to his arrival\r\nat Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there;\r\nbut, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a\r\nsudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond\r\nnature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took\r\npossession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended\r\nin good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in\r\nthe tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail\r\nwithin the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible\r\ndelays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised\r\nhimself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at\r\nthe thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his\r\nunpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed\r\nthan Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the\r\ndays passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and\r\naccusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not\r\nhaving bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while\r\nit was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could\r\nnot be done on the railway.\r\n\r\nThe train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate\r\nthe Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir\r\nFrancis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on\r\nconsulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This\r\nfamous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was\r\nnow some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow.\r\nSir Francis corrected Passepartout’s time, whereupon the latter made\r\nthe same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting\r\nthat the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was\r\nconstantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and\r\ntherefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone\r\nover, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he\r\nkept at London time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm no\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe train stopped, at eight o’clock, in the midst of a glade some\r\nfifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and\r\nworkmen’s cabins. The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted,\r\n“Passengers will get out here!”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the\r\ngeneral could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of\r\ndates and acacias.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned,\r\ncrying: “Monsieur, no more railway!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Sir Francis.\r\n\r\n“I mean to say that the train isn’t going on.”\r\n\r\nThe general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed\r\nhim, and they proceeded together to the conductor.\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” asked Sir Francis.\r\n\r\n“At the hamlet of Kholby.”\r\n\r\n“Do we stop here?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The railway isn’t finished.”\r\n\r\n“What! not finished?”\r\n\r\n“No. There’s still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to\r\nAllahabad, where the line begins again.”\r\n\r\n“But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,” retorted Sir Francis,\r\nwho was growing warm.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” replied the conductor; “but the passengers know that they\r\nmust provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to\r\nAllahabad.”\r\n\r\nSir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have knocked the\r\nconductor down, and did not dare to look at his master.\r\n\r\n“Sir Francis,” said Mr. Fogg quietly, “we will, if you please, look\r\nabout for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.”\r\n\r\n“What! You knew that the way—”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or\r\nlater arise on my route. Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have two days,\r\nwhich I have already gained, to sacrifice. A steamer leaves Calcutta\r\nfor Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th. This is the 22nd, and we shall\r\nreach Calcutta in time.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to say to so confident a response.\r\n\r\nIt was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this\r\npoint. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting\r\ntoo fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the\r\ncompletion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware\r\nof this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such\r\nvehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons\r\ndrawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas,\r\npalanquins, ponies, and what not.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end\r\nto end, came back without having found anything.\r\n\r\n“I shall go afoot,” said Phileas Fogg.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as\r\nhe thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he\r\ntoo had been looking about him, and, after a moment’s hesitation, said,\r\n“Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a\r\nhundred steps from here.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go and see the elephant,” replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high\r\npalings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut,\r\nand, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The\r\nelephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but\r\nfor warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun\r\nalready, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on\r\nsugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this\r\nmethod being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for\r\nbattle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal’s instruction in\r\nthis direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his\r\nnatural gentleness. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could\r\ndoubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other\r\nmeans of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are\r\nfar from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males,\r\nwhich alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially\r\nas but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed\r\nto the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg\r\npersisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the\r\nloan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also.\r\nForty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but\r\nthe Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one,\r\nfor, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad,\r\nhis owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to\r\npurchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds\r\nfor him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great\r\nbargain, still refused.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect\r\nbefore he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was\r\nnot in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds\r\nwas at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and\r\nthat he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value.\r\nReturning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with\r\navarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a\r\nprice he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then\r\nfifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout,\r\nusually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\r\n\r\nAt two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\r\n\r\n“What a price, good heavens!” cried Passepartout, “for an elephant.”\r\n\r\nIt only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy. A\r\nyoung Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr.\r\nFogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially\r\nstimulate his zeal. The elephant was led out and equipped. The Parsee,\r\nwho was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with a sort\r\nof saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some curiously\r\nuncomfortable howdahs. Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes\r\nwhich he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a proceeding that seemed\r\nto deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals. Then he offered to carry\r\nSir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier gratefully accepted, as\r\none traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic\r\nbeast. Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and\r\nMr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the\r\nsaddle-cloth between them. The Parsee perched himself on the elephant’s\r\nneck, and at nine o’clock they set out from the village, the animal\r\nmarching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut."
