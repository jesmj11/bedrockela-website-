      "text": "BRAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable.\r\nMr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore the\r\nsuccess of his tour. But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir\r\nFrancis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.\r\n\r\nAs for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed.\r\nHis master’s idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that\r\nicy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg.\r\n\r\nThere remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would he not take\r\npart with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it was necessary\r\nto be assured of his neutrality.\r\n\r\nSir Francis frankly put the question to him.\r\n\r\n“Officers,” replied the guide, “I am a Parsee, and this woman is a\r\nParsee. Command me as you will.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“However,” resumed the guide, “it is certain, not only that we shall\r\nrisk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken.”\r\n\r\n“That is foreseen,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I think we must wait till night\r\nbefore acting.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said the guide.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said,\r\nwas a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a\r\nwealthy Bombay merchant. She had received a thoroughly English\r\neducation in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would\r\nbe thought an European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, she was\r\nmarried against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing\r\nthe fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the\r\nrajah’s relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice\r\nfrom which it seemed she could not escape.\r\n\r\nThe Parsee’s narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in\r\ntheir generous design. It was decided that the guide should direct the\r\nelephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached\r\nas quickly as possible. They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a\r\ncopse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well\r\nconcealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nThey then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The guide was\r\nfamiliar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the\r\nyoung woman was imprisoned. Could they enter any of its doors while the\r\nwhole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer\r\nto attempt to make a hole in the walls? This could only be determined\r\nat the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the\r\nabduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the\r\nvictim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could\r\nsave her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as night fell, about six o’clock, they decided to make a\r\nreconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were just\r\nceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the\r\ndrunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be\r\npossible to slip between them to the temple itself.\r\n\r\nThe Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and\r\nin ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream,\r\nwhence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of\r\nwood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was\r\nto be burned with his wife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the\r\ntrees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\r\n\r\n“Come!” whispered the guide.\r\n\r\nHe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his\r\ncompanions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of\r\nthe wind among the branches.\r\n\r\nSoon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up\r\nby the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians,\r\nmotionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with\r\nthe dead. Men, women, and children lay together.\r\n\r\nIn the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed\r\ndistinctly. Much to the guide’s disappointment, the guards of the\r\nrajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to\r\nand fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance\r\nto the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.\r\nPhileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be\r\nattempted in that direction. They stopped, and engaged in a whispered\r\ncolloquy.\r\n\r\n“It is only eight now,” said the brigadier, “and these guards may also\r\ngo to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“It is not impossible,” returned the Parsee.\r\n\r\nThey lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an\r\nobservation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by\r\nthe glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of\r\nthe pagoda.\r\n\r\nThey waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards,\r\nand it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be\r\ncounted on. The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls\r\nof the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the\r\npriests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as\r\nwere the soldiers at the door.\r\n\r\nAfter a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for\r\nthe attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a\r\nroundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They reached\r\nthe walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there\r\nwas no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon,\r\nand was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be\r\naccomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their\r\npocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood,\r\nwhich could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had\r\nbeen taken out, the rest would yield easily.\r\n\r\nThey set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and\r\nPassepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an\r\naperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a\r\ncry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly\r\nby other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout and the guide\r\nstopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being given? Common\r\nprudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas\r\nFogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited\r\ntill the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves\r\nready to resume their attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the\r\nguards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed\r\nthemselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus\r\ninterrupted in their work. They could not now reach the victim; how,\r\nthen, could they save her? Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout\r\nwas beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage. The\r\ntranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.\r\n\r\n“We have nothing to do but to go away,” whispered Sir Francis.\r\n\r\n“Nothing but to go away,” echoed the guide.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Fogg. “I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.”\r\n\r\n“But what can you hope to do?” asked Sir Francis. “In a few hours it\r\nwill be daylight, and—”\r\n\r\n“The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nSir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg’s eyes. What was this\r\ncool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make a rush for the\r\nyoung woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch her\r\nfrom her executioners?\r\n\r\nThis would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such\r\na fool. Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this\r\nterrible drama. The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where they\r\nwere able to observe the sleeping groups.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches\r\nof a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a\r\nflash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain.\r\n\r\nHe had commenced by saying to himself, “What folly!” and then he\r\nrepeated, “Why not, after all? It’s a chance,—perhaps the only one; and\r\nwith such sots!” Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a\r\nserpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of\r\nday, though it was not yet light. This was the moment. The slumbering\r\nmultitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries\r\narose; the hour of the sacrifice had come. The doors of the pagoda\r\nswung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst\r\nof which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed, having\r\nshaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from\r\nher executioner. Sir Francis’s heart throbbed; and, convulsively\r\nseizing Mr. Fogg’s hand, found in it an open knife. Just at this moment\r\nthe crowd began to move. The young woman had again fallen into a stupor\r\ncaused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted\r\nher with their wild, religious cries.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the\r\ncrowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the\r\nstream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the\r\nrajah’s corpse. In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite\r\nsenseless, stretched out beside her husband’s body. Then a torch was\r\nbrought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in\r\nan instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre. But he\r\nhad quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. A\r\ncry of terror arose. The whole multitude prostrated themselves,\r\nterror-stricken, on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a\r\nspectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in\r\nthe midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nFakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there,\r\nwith their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their eyes and\r\nbehold such a prodigy.\r\n\r\nThe inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which\r\nsupported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden. Mr.\r\nFogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and\r\nPassepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied.\r\n\r\nThe resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an\r\nabrupt tone, said, “Let us be off!”\r\n\r\nIt was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst\r\nof the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had\r\ndelivered the young woman from death! It was Passepartout who, playing\r\nhis part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the\r\ngeneral terror.\r\n\r\nA moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and\r\nthe elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. But the cries and\r\nnoise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg’s hat, apprised\r\nthem that the trick had been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe old rajah’s body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre; and\r\nthe priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction\r\nhad taken place. They hastened into the forest, followed by the\r\nsoldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter\r\nrapidly increased the distance between them, and ere long found\r\nthemselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows."
