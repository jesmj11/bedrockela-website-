      "text": "HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Rangoon”—one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s boats plying\r\nin the Chinese and Japanese seas—was a screw steamer, built of iron,\r\nweighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with engines of\r\nfour hundred horse-power. She was as fast, but not as well fitted up,\r\nas the “Mongolia,” and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on\r\nboard of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished. However, the trip from\r\nCalcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred\r\nmiles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not\r\ndifficult to please.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted\r\nwith her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude\r\nfor what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her,\r\napparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner\r\nbetraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the\r\nwatch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda’s comfort. He visited her\r\nregularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to\r\nsit and hear her talk. He treated her with the strictest politeness,\r\nbut with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been\r\narranged for this purpose. Aouda did not quite know what to make of\r\nhim, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master’s\r\neccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was\r\nsending him round the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life,\r\nand she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nAouda confirmed the Parsee guide’s narrative of her touching history.\r\nShe did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India.\r\nMany of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing\r\nin cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet\r\nby the English government. Aouda was a relative of this great man, and\r\nit was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.\r\nWhether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr.\r\nFogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything\r\nwould be mathematically—he used the very word—arranged. Aouda fastened\r\nher great eyes, “clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,” upon him;\r\nbut the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all\r\ninclined to throw himself into this lake.\r\n\r\nThe first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable\r\nweather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great\r\nAndaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its\r\npicturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming\r\nabove the waters. The steamer passed along near the shores, but the\r\nsavage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not,\r\nas has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. Vast\r\nforests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and\r\ntree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful\r\noutlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the\r\ncoasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a\r\nluxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire. The varied\r\nlandscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and\r\nthe “Rangoon” rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave\r\naccess to the China seas.\r\n\r\nWhat was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country,\r\ndoing all this while? He had managed to embark on the “Rangoon” at\r\nCalcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that,\r\nif the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong\r\nKong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It\r\nwould have been difficult to explain why he was on board without\r\nawakening Passepartout’s suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay.\r\nBut necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance\r\nwith the worthy servant, as will be seen.\r\n\r\nAll the detective’s hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for\r\nthe steamer’s stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to\r\ntake any steps there. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the\r\nrobber would probably escape him for ever. Hong Kong was the last\r\nEnglish ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan,\r\nAmerica offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should\r\nat last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give\r\nhim into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further\r\ntrouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail;\r\nan extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in\r\ndelays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nFix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he\r\nspent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, “Now, either the\r\nwarrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or\r\nit will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I\r\nshould delay his departure. I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed\r\nat Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost: Cost what\r\nit may, I _must_ succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if\r\nthat should turn out to be my last resource?”\r\n\r\nFix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a\r\nconfidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his\r\nmaster really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg’s accomplice, he was\r\nvery certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of\r\nbeing himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally\r\nof the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be\r\nemployed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to\r\nhis master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore\r\nstrait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on\r\nthe “Rangoon,” in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nWho was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg’s\r\ntravelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay\r\nand Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone\r\ninto the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was\r\nfairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked\r\nelopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he\r\ndetermined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young\r\nwoman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties\r\nfor Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nBut could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an\r\nabominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before\r\nanything could be effected, might get full under way again for\r\nYokohama.\r\n\r\nFix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the\r\n“Rangoon” before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the steamer\r\nstopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong.\r\nHe finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to\r\nquestion Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk; and,\r\nas there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the “Rangoon”\r\nwas due at Singapore.\r\n\r\nFix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was\r\npromenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The\r\ndetective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and\r\nexclaimed, “You here, on the ‘Rangoon’?”\r\n\r\n“What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?” returned the really astonished\r\nPassepartout, recognising his crony of the “Mongolia.” “Why, I left you\r\nat Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going\r\nround the world too?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” replied Fix; “I shall stop at Hong Kong—at least for some\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. “But how\r\nis it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness—I’ve been staying in my berth. The Gulf\r\nof Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean. And how\r\nis Mr. Fogg?”\r\n\r\n“As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! But, Monsieur\r\nFix, you don’t know that we have a young lady with us.”\r\n\r\n“A young lady?” replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\nPassepartout thereupon recounted Aouda’s history, the affair at the\r\nBombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds,\r\nthe rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the\r\nrestoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. Fix, who was\r\nfamiliar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all\r\nthat Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so\r\ninterested a listener.\r\n\r\n“But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of\r\none of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to be done there,” said Fix to himself, concealing his\r\ndisappointment. “A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on\r\nboard the ‘Rangoon.’”"
