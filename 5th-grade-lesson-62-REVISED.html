      "text": "The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview,\r\nthough Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to\r\ndivulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that\r\nmysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined\r\nhimself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his\r\ninveterate habit, took a hand at whist.\r\n\r\nPassepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance\r\nkept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really\r\nworth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent\r\nperson, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board\r\nthe “Mongolia,” who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his\r\ndestination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the “Rangoon,” was\r\nfollowing Mr. Fogg’s tracks step by step. What was Fix’s object?\r\nPassepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes—which he religiously\r\npreserved—that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with\r\nthem, and probably on the same steamer.\r\n\r\nPassepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without\r\nhitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never\r\ncould have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber\r\naround the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution\r\nof every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of\r\nFix’s movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he\r\nthought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg’s friends at the Reform\r\nClub, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round\r\nthe world as had been agreed upon.\r\n\r\n“It’s clear!” repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his\r\nshrewdness. “He’s a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn’t quite the\r\nthing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man! Ah,\r\ngentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to\r\nhis master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the\r\npart of his adversaries. But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had\r\nthe chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray\r\nhis real suspicions.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the “Rangoon” entered\r\nthe Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from\r\nSumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of\r\nthis noble island from the view of the travellers. The “Rangoon”\r\nweighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal,\r\nhaving gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas\r\nFogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda,\r\nwho betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.\r\n\r\nFix, who suspected Mr. Fogg’s every movement, followed them cautiously,\r\nwithout being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his\r\nsleeve at Fix’s manœuvres, went about his usual errands.\r\n\r\nThe island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no\r\nmountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park\r\ncheckered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn\r\nby a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda\r\ninto the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of\r\nclove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower.\r\nPepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;\r\nsago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of\r\nthis tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air\r\nwith a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped\r\nabout in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.\r\n\r\nAfter a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg\r\nreturned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking,\r\nirregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical\r\nfruits and plants; and at ten o’clock they re-embarked, closely\r\nfollowed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes—a fruit as\r\nlarge as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright\r\nred within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords\r\ngourmands a delicious sensation—was waiting for them on deck. He was\r\nonly too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very\r\ngracefully for them.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock the “Rangoon” rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a\r\nfew hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited\r\nby the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view.\r\nSingapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of\r\nHong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast.\r\nPhileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be\r\nin time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for\r\nYokohama, the principal Japanese port.\r\n\r\nThe “Rangoon” had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked\r\nat Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen,\r\nMalays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.\r\n\r\nThe weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last\r\nquarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals\r\nrose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus\r\naided the steamer’s progress. The captain as often as possible put up\r\nhis sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel\r\nmade rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to\r\nthe defective construction of the “Rangoon,” however, unusual\r\nprecautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of\r\ntime which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout\r\nout of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least.\r\nPassepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and\r\nconsigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the\r\npepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly\r\nburning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n“You are in a great hurry, then,” said Fix to him one day, “to reach\r\nHong Kong?”\r\n\r\n“A very great hurry!”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?”\r\n\r\n“Terribly anxious.”\r\n\r\n“You believe in this journey around the world, then?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely. Don’t you, Mr. Fix?”\r\n\r\n“I? I don’t believe a word of it.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a sly dog!” said Passepartout, winking at him.\r\n\r\nThis expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. Had the\r\nFrenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to think. But how\r\ncould Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? Yet, in\r\nspeaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed.\r\n\r\nPassepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fix,” said he, in a bantering tone, “shall we be so unfortunate as\r\nto lose you when we get to Hong Kong?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” responded Fix, a little embarrassed, “I don’t know; perhaps—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular\r\nCompany, you know, can’t stop on the way! You were only going to\r\nBombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from\r\nAmerica to Europe is only a step.”\r\n\r\nFix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene\r\nas possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout persisted in\r\nchaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and no,” returned Fix; “there is good and bad luck in such\r\nthings. But you must understand that I don’t travel at my own expense.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am quite sure of that!” cried Passepartout, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\nFix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his\r\nreflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman\r\nhad found out that he was a detective. But had he told his master? What\r\npart was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? Was the\r\ngame, then, up? Fix spent several hours turning these things over in\r\nhis mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself\r\nthat Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course\r\nit was best to take.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved\r\nto deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it practicable to\r\narrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that\r\nlast foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout\r\nall. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this\r\ncase the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the\r\nservant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be\r\nto abandon the robber.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile Phileas\r\nFogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious\r\nindifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around the\r\nworld, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet\r\nthere was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star,\r\nwhich might have produced an agitation in this gentleman’s heart. But\r\nno! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout’s great\r\nsurprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more\r\ndifficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery\r\nof Neptune.\r\n\r\nIt was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in\r\nAouda’s eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg,\r\nthough brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to\r\nthe sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was\r\nclearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in\r\nperpetual reveries.\r\n\r\nOne day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was\r\nobserving the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the\r\nscrew out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and\r\nthis made Passepartout indignant.\r\n\r\n“The valves are not sufficiently charged!” he exclaimed. “We are not\r\ngoing. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow\r\nup, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!”"
