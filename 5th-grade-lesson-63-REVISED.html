      "text": "WHAT COMES OF IT\r\n\r\n\r\nHong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by\r\nthe Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius\r\nof the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent\r\nport. The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is\r\nseparated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on\r\nthe opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the\r\nChinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of\r\nChinese goods finds its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals,\r\nwharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets,\r\ngive to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey\r\ntransferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.\r\n\r\nPassepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the\r\nVictoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other\r\nmodes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans\r\nwho passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not\r\nunlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed\r\neverywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he\r\nfound a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French,\r\nAmerican, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and\r\nChinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many\r\nfloating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the\r\nnatives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a\r\nbarber’s to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at\r\nleast eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow,\r\nwhich is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing\r\nwhy, thought this very funny.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the quay where they were to embark on the “Carnatic,” he\r\nwas not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective\r\nseemed very much disturbed and disappointed.\r\n\r\n“This is bad,” muttered Passepartout, “for the gentlemen of the Reform\r\nClub!” He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived\r\nthat gentleman’s chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to\r\ninveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not\r\ncome! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now\r\nreach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English\r\nterritory on Mr. Fogg’s route, the robber would escape, unless he could\r\nmanage to detain him.\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur Fix,” said Passepartout, “have you decided to go with\r\nus so far as America?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Fix, through his set teeth.\r\n\r\n“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. “I knew you could\r\nnot persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth.”\r\n\r\nThey entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons.\r\nThe clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs\r\non the “Carnatic” having been completed, the steamer would leave that\r\nvery evening, and not next morning, as had been announced.\r\n\r\n“That will suit my master all the better,” said Passepartout. “I will\r\ngo and let him know.”\r\n\r\nFix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout\r\nall. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg\r\nseveral days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion\r\ninto a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found\r\nthemselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which\r\nwas a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon\r\nthis bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about\r\nthe room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin,\r\nand brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little\r\nballs of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of\r\nthe smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table,\r\nwhereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and\r\nlaid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these\r\nstupefied sots.\r\n\r\nFix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by\r\nthose wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English\r\nmerchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the\r\namount of one million four hundred thousand pounds—thousands devoted to\r\none of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese\r\ngovernment has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent\r\nlaws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first\r\nexclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could\r\nnot be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and\r\nwomen, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims\r\ncannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily\r\ncontortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight\r\npipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens\r\nthat Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found\r\nthemselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix’s\r\ninvitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.\r\n\r\nThey ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample\r\njustice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted\r\nabout the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea\r\nthat Fix was going to continue it with them. When the bottles were\r\nempty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the\r\ntime of the sailing of the “Carnatic.”\r\n\r\nFix caught him by the arm, and said, “Wait a moment.”\r\n\r\n“What for, Mr. Fix?”\r\n\r\n“I want to have a serious talk with you.”\r\n\r\n“A serious talk!” cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that\r\nwas left in the bottom of his glass. “Well, we’ll talk about it\r\nto-morrow; I haven’t time now.”\r\n\r\n“Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix’s face\r\nseemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n“What is it that you have to say?”\r\n\r\nFix placed his hand upon Passepartout’s arm, and, lowering his voice,\r\nsaid, “You have guessed who I am?”\r\n\r\n“Parbleu!” said Passepartout, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Then I’m going to tell you everything—”\r\n\r\n“Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that’s very good. But go\r\non, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put\r\nthemselves to a useless expense.”\r\n\r\n“Useless!” said Fix. “You speak confidently. It’s clear that you don’t\r\nknow how large the sum is.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do,” returned Passepartout. “Twenty thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty-five thousand!” answered Fix, pressing his companion’s hand.\r\n\r\n“What!” cried the Frenchman. “Has Monsieur Fogg dared—fifty-five\r\nthousand pounds! Well, there’s all the more reason for not losing an\r\ninstant,” he continued, getting up hastily.\r\n\r\nFix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: “Fifty-five\r\nthousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you’ll\r\nhelp me, I’ll let you have five hundred of them.”\r\n\r\n“Help you?” cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.\r\n\r\n“Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with\r\nfollowing my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put\r\nobstacles in his way! I blush for them!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well\r\nwaylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what we count on doing.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a conspiracy, then,” cried Passepartout, who became more and more\r\nexcited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without\r\nperceiving it. “A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!”\r\n\r\nFix began to be puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Members of the Reform Club!” continued Passepartout. “You must know,\r\nMonsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes\r\na wager, he tries to win it fairly!”\r\n\r\n“But who do you think I am?” asked Fix, looking at him intently.\r\n\r\n“Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to\r\ninterrupt my master’s journey. But, though I found you out some time\r\nago, I’ve taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg.”\r\n\r\n“He knows nothing, then?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.\r\n\r\nThe detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he\r\nspoke again. What should he do? Passepartout’s mistake seemed sincere,\r\nbut it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant\r\nwas not the master’s accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the detective to himself, “as he is not an accomplice, he\r\nwill help me.”\r\n\r\nHe had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he\r\nresolved to make a clean breast of it.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” said Fix abruptly. “I am not, as you think, an agent of\r\nthe members of the Reform Club—”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.\r\n\r\n“I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.”\r\n\r\n“You, a detective?”\r\n\r\n“I will prove it. Here is my commission.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this\r\ndocument, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fogg’s wager,” resumed Fix, “is only a pretext, of which you and\r\nthe gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing\r\nyour innocent complicity.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand\r\npounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose\r\ndescription was fortunately secured. Here is his description; it\r\nanswers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!” cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist.\r\n“My master is the most honourable of men!”\r\n\r\n“How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went into\r\nhis service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish\r\npretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes. And\r\nyet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?”\r\n\r\nPassepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his\r\nhands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the\r\nsaviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how\r\nmany presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to\r\nreject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not\r\nwish to believe that his master was guilty.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you want of me?” said he, at last, with an effort.\r\n\r\n“See here,” replied Fix; “I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as\r\nyet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to\r\nLondon. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong—”\r\n\r\n“I! But I—”\r\n\r\n“I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the\r\nBank of England.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back,\r\nexhausted in mind and body.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fix,” he stammered, “even should what you say be true—if my master\r\nis really the robber you are seeking for—which I deny—I have been, am,\r\nin his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will\r\nnever betray him—not for all the gold in the world. I come from a\r\nvillage where they don’t eat that kind of bread!”\r\n\r\n“You refuse?”\r\n\r\n“I refuse.”\r\n\r\n“Consider that I’ve said nothing,” said Fix; “and let us drink.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; let us drink!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the\r\nliquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his\r\nmaster, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay\r\nupon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout’s hand. He took it,\r\nput it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head,\r\nbecoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“At last!” said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. “Mr. Fogg will\r\nnot be informed of the ‘Carnatic’s’ departure; and, if he is, he will\r\nhave to go without this cursed Frenchman!”\r\n\r\nAnd, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern."
