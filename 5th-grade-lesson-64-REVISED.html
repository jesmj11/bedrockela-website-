      "title": "Chapter 21: IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE “TANKADERE” RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A",
      "text": "REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of\r\ntwenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese seas are\r\nusually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially\r\nduring the equinoxes; and it was now early November.\r\n\r\nIt would clearly have been to the master’s advantage to carry his\r\npassengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he\r\nwould have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent\r\neven to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the\r\n“Tankadere,” which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was\r\nnot wrong.\r\n\r\nLate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong\r\nKong, and the “Tankadere,” impelled by favourable winds, conducted\r\nherself admirably.\r\n\r\n“I do not need, pilot,” said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open\r\nsea, “to advise you to use all possible speed.”\r\n\r\n“Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the wind will let\r\nus. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going\r\ninto port.”\r\n\r\n“It’s your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a\r\nsailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The young\r\nwoman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out\r\nupon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had\r\nventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head rustled the white sails,\r\nwhich seemed like great white wings. The boat, carried forward by the\r\nwind, seemed to be flying in the air.\r\n\r\nNight came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her\r\ninsufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon.\r\nClouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThe pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these\r\nseas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not\r\nuncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock\r\nwould shatter the gallant little craft.\r\n\r\nFix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept apart\r\nfrom his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg’s taciturn tastes;\r\nbesides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had\r\naccepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that\r\nFogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for\r\nSan Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity\r\nand safety. Fogg’s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.\r\nInstead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a\r\ncommon villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to\r\ngain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the\r\npolice off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune\r\nstolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he,\r\nFix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he\r\nhad secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an\r\nhour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. At all\r\nevents, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not\r\nwith his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences\r\nFix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely\r\ndisappeared. Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did not\r\nseem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have\r\nembarked on the “Carnatic” at the last moment; and this was also\r\nAouda’s opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow\r\nto whom she owed so much. They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if\r\nthe “Carnatic” was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain\r\nif he had been on board.\r\n\r\nA brisk breeze arose about ten o’clock; but, though it might have been\r\nprudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the\r\nheavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. The “Tankadere” bore\r\nsail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was\r\nprepared for high speed in case of a gale.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been\r\nalready preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots. The\r\npilot and crew remained on deck all night.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more\r\nthan one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed of between eight\r\nand nine miles. The “Tankadere” still carried all sail, and was\r\naccomplishing her greatest capacity of speed. If the wind held as it\r\nwas, the chances would be in her favour. During the day she kept along\r\nthe coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in\r\nprofile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five\r\nmiles distant. The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off\r\nland—a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing\r\nto its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\r\n\r\nThe breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the\r\nsouth-west. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within\r\ntwo hours, as the wind freshened up anew.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate\r\nwith a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he\r\naccepted with secret chagrin. To travel at this man’s expense and live\r\nupon his provisions was not palatable to him. Still, he was obliged to\r\neat, and so he ate.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, “sir”—this\r\n“sir” scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid\r\ncollaring this “gentleman”—“sir, you have been very kind to give me a\r\npassage on this boat. But, though my means will not admit of my\r\nexpending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share—”\r\n\r\n“Let us not speak of that, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“But, if I insist—”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply.\r\n“This enters into my general expenses.”\r\n\r\nFix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he\r\nensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high\r\nhope. He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai\r\nin time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it. The\r\ncrew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be gained.\r\nThere was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which was not\r\nvigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the\r\nhelm. They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal\r\nyacht regatta.\r\n\r\nBy evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been\r\naccomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be\r\nable to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in\r\nwhich case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he\r\nleft London would not seriously affect his journey.\r\n\r\nThe “Tankadere” entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the\r\nisland of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the\r\nnight, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the\r\nstraits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the\r\nchopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to\r\nstand on deck.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed\r\nto predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury\r\nrising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east,\r\nraised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the\r\nevening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent\r\nscintillations of the ocean.\r\n\r\nJohn Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,\r\nmuttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a low\r\nvoice to Mr. Fogg, “Shall I speak out to your honour?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we are going to have a squall.”\r\n\r\n“Is the wind north or south?” asked Mr. Fogg quietly.\r\n\r\n“South. Look! a typhoon is coming up.”\r\n\r\n“Glad it’s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you take it that way,” said John Bunsby, “I’ve nothing more to\r\nsay.” John Bunsby’s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced\r\nseason of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist,\r\nwould have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but\r\nin the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them\r\nwith great violence.\r\n\r\nThe pilot took his precautions in advance. He reefed all sail, the\r\npole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows. A\r\nsingle triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib,\r\nso as to hold the wind from behind. Then they waited.\r\n\r\nJohn Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this\r\nimprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat\r\nbouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor\r\nAouda consented to leave the deck.\r\n\r\nThe storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o’clock.\r\nWith but its bit of sail, the “Tankadere” was lifted like a feather by\r\na wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her\r\nspeed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be\r\nbelow the truth.\r\n\r\nThe boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by\r\nmonstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to\r\ntheirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these\r\nmountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of\r\nthe pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but\r\nthey submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but\r\nAouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed\r\nher, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As\r\nfor Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the “Tankadere” had always held her course to the\r\nnorth; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down\r\nfrom the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves,\r\nshook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence. At\r\nnight the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby saw the approach\r\nof darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings. He\r\nthought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken\r\nspeed. After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, “I think,\r\nyour honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the\r\ncoast.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the pilot. “But which one?”\r\n\r\n“I know of but one,” returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\r\n\r\n“And that is—”\r\n\r\n“Shanghai.”\r\n\r\nThe pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely\r\nrealise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, “Well—yes!\r\nYour honour is right. To Shanghai!”\r\n\r\nSo the “Tankadere” kept steadily on her northward track.\r\n\r\nThe night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did\r\nnot founder. Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had\r\nnot been constantly on the watch. Aouda was exhausted, but did not\r\nutter a complaint. More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from\r\nthe violence of the waves.\r\n\r\nDay reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the\r\nwind now returned to the south-east. It was a favourable change, and\r\nthe “Tankadere” again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though\r\nthe waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks\r\nwhich would have crushed a craft less solidly built. From time to time\r\nthe coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in\r\nsight. The “Tankadere” was alone upon the sea.\r\n\r\nThere were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct\r\nas the sun descended toward the horizon. The tempest had been as brief\r\nas terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a\r\nlittle, and take some repose.\r\n\r\nThe night was comparatively quiet. Some of the sails were again\r\nhoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good. The next morning at\r\ndawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that\r\nthey were not one hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred miles, and\r\nonly one day to traverse them! That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at\r\nShanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama. Had there\r\nbeen no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would be at\r\nthis moment within thirty miles of their destination.\r\n\r\nThe wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it. All\r\nsails were now hoisted, and at noon the “Tankadere” was within\r\nforty-five miles of Shanghai. There remained yet six hours in which to\r\naccomplish that distance. All on board feared that it could not be\r\ndone, and every one—Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted—felt his heart\r\nbeat with impatience. The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an\r\nhour, and the wind was becoming calmer every moment! It was a\r\ncapricious breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea\r\nbecame smooth. Still, the “Tankadere” was so light, and her fine sails\r\ncaught the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents\r\nJohn Bunsby found himself at six o’clock not more than ten miles from\r\nthe mouth of Shanghai River. Shanghai itself is situated at least\r\ntwelve miles up the stream. At seven they were still three miles from\r\nShanghai. The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred\r\npounds was evidently on the point of escaping him. He looked at Mr.\r\nFogg. Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was at\r\nthis moment at stake.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of\r\nsmoke, appeared on the edge of the waters. It was the American steamer,\r\nleaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.\r\n\r\n“Confound her!” cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a\r\ndesperate jerk.\r\n\r\n“Signal her!” said Phileas Fogg quietly.\r\n\r\nA small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the “Tankadere,” for\r\nmaking signals in the fogs. It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as\r\nthe pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg\r\nsaid, “Hoist your flag!”\r\n\r\nThe flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of\r\ndistress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would\r\nchange her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat.\r\n\r\n“Fire!” said Mr. Fogg. And the booming of the little cannon resounded\r\nin the air."
