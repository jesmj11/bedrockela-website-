      "title": "Chapter 24: DURING WHICH MR. FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN",
      "text": "What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be\r\neasily guessed. The signals made by the “Tankadere” had been seen by\r\nthe captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, espying the flag at\r\nhalf-mast, had directed his course towards the little craft. Phileas\r\nFogg, after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby,\r\nand rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and\r\nfifty pounds, ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix; and they started\r\nat once for Nagasaki and Yokohama.\r\n\r\nThey reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November.\r\nPhileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the “Carnatic,” where he\r\nlearned, to Aouda’s great delight—and perhaps to his own, though he\r\nbetrayed no emotion—that Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived\r\non her the day before.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and\r\nit became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay.\r\nMr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after\r\nwandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding\r\nhis missing servant. Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last\r\nled him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar’s theatre. He certainly would\r\nnot have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank’s costume;\r\nbut the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the gallery.\r\nHe could not help starting, which so changed the position of his nose\r\nas to bring the “pyramid” pell-mell upon the stage.\r\n\r\nAll this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to him what had\r\ntaken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the\r\n“Tankadere,” in company with one Mr. Fix.\r\n\r\nPassepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name. He\r\nthought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what\r\nhad taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account\r\nhe gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been\r\novertaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then\r\nfurnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in\r\nharmony with his position. Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his\r\nnose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him which\r\nrecalled the sectary of the god Tingou.\r\n\r\nThe steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco\r\nbelonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the\r\n“General Grant.” She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand\r\nfive hundred tons; well equipped and very fast. The massive\r\nwalking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod\r\nworked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in\r\nchanging the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly\r\nconnected with the shaft of the paddles. The “General Grant” was rigged\r\nwith three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus\r\nmaterially aiding the steam power. By making twelve miles an hour, she\r\nwould cross the ocean in twenty-one days. Phileas Fogg was therefore\r\njustified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of\r\nDecember, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th—thus gaining\r\nseveral hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.\r\n\r\nThere was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English,\r\nmany Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California,\r\nand several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in\r\nmaking the tour of the world. Nothing of moment happened on the voyage;\r\nthe steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little, and the\r\n“Pacific” almost justified its name. Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn\r\nas ever. His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him\r\nby other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed\r\nher more than she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she\r\nyielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon\r\nher protector. Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans, and became\r\nimpatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey.\r\n\r\nShe often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the\r\nstate of the lady’s heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics,\r\nhe never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg’s honesty, generosity,\r\nand devotion. He took pains to calm Aouda’s doubts of a successful\r\ntermination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of\r\nit had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of\r\nJapan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places\r\nagain. A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a\r\ntransatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring\r\nthem to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the\r\nperiod agreed upon.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed\r\nexactly one half of the terrestrial globe. The “General Grant” passed,\r\non the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and\r\nwas at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true,\r\nexhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the\r\ntour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only\r\nhalf-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long\r\ncircuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to\r\nSingapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed\r\nwithout deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the\r\nwhole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles;\r\nwhereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to\r\ntraverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November,\r\naccomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a\r\nstraight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their\r\nway!\r\n\r\nIt happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a\r\njoyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had\r\ninsisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on\r\nregarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false\r\nand unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands,\r\nhe found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship’s chronometers.\r\nHis triumph was hilarious. He would have liked to know what Fix would\r\nsay if he were aboard!\r\n\r\n“The rogue told me a lot of stories,” repeated Passepartout, “about the\r\nmeridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! moonshine more likely!\r\nIf one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would\r\nkeep! I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my\r\nwatch!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been\r\ndivided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have\r\nno reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then,\r\ninstead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine\r\no’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight\r\nprecisely the difference between London time and that of the one\r\nhundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain\r\nthis purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even\r\nif he had comprehended it. Moreover, if the detective had been on board\r\nat that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a\r\nquite different subject, and in an entirely different manner.\r\n\r\nWhere was Fix at that moment?\r\n\r\nHe was actually on board the “General Grant.”\r\n\r\nOn reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected\r\nto meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English\r\nconsulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest. It had\r\nfollowed him from Bombay, and had come by the “Carnatic,” on which\r\nsteamer he himself was supposed to be. Fix’s disappointment may be\r\nimagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless. Mr. Fogg\r\nhad left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his\r\nextradition!\r\n\r\n“Well,” thought Fix, after a moment of anger, “my warrant is not good\r\nhere, but it will be in England. The rogue evidently intends to return\r\nto his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track.\r\nGood! I will follow him across the Atlantic. As for the money, heaven\r\ngrant there may be some left! But the fellow has already spent in\r\ntravelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges,\r\nmore than five thousand pounds. Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!”\r\n\r\nHis course decided on, he went on board the “General Grant,” and was\r\nthere when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived. To his utter amazement, he\r\nrecognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise. He quickly\r\nconcealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and\r\nhoped—thanks to the number of passengers—to remain unperceived by Mr.\r\nFogg’s servant.\r\n\r\nOn that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the\r\nforward deck. The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped\r\nhim by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans,\r\nwho immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a\r\nperfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French\r\nover English pugilistic skill.\r\n\r\nWhen Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and\r\ncomforted. Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at\r\nhis adversary, coldly said, “Have you done?”\r\n\r\n“For this time—yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me have a word with you.”\r\n\r\n“But I—”\r\n\r\n“In your master’s interests.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix’s coolness, for he quietly\r\nfollowed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers.\r\n\r\n“You have given me a thrashing,” said Fix. “Good, I expected it. Now,\r\nlisten to me. Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg’s adversary. I am\r\nnow in his game.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” cried Passepartout; “you are convinced he is an honest man?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Fix coldly, “I think him a rascal. Sh! don’t budge, and\r\nlet me speak. As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my\r\ninterest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived. I did\r\neverything I could to keep him back. I sent the Bombay priests after\r\nhim, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and\r\nI made him miss the Yokohama steamer.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout listened, with closed fists.\r\n\r\n“Now,” resumed Fix, “Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England. Well,\r\nI will follow him there. But hereafter I will do as much to keep\r\nobstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in\r\nhis path. I’ve changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for\r\nmy interest to change it. Your interest is the same as mine; for it is\r\nonly in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service\r\nof a criminal or an honest man.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced that\r\nhe spoke with entire good faith.\r\n\r\n“Are we friends?” asked the detective.\r\n\r\n“Friends?—no,” replied Passepartout; “but allies, perhaps. At the least\r\nsign of treason, however, I’ll twist your neck for you.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” said the detective quietly.\r\n\r\nEleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the “General Grant” entered\r\nthe bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day."
