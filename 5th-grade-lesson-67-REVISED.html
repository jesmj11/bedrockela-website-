      "title": "Chapter 25: IN WHICH A SLIGHT GLIMPSE IS HAD OF SAN FRANCISCO",
      "text": "It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set\r\nfoot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the\r\nfloating quay upon which they disembarked. These quays, rising and\r\nfalling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of\r\nvessels. Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all\r\nnationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above\r\nthe other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries. There were\r\nalso heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico,\r\nChili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and all the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent,\r\nthought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine\r\nstyle; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them.\r\nPut out of countenance by the manner in which he thus “set foot” upon\r\nthe New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the\r\ninnumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these\r\nmovable quays, that they flew noisily away.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the\r\nfirst train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o’clock\r\np.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian\r\ncapital. Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda\r\nentered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and\r\nthey set out for the International Hotel.\r\n\r\nFrom his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the\r\nwide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic\r\nchurches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses,\r\nthe numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the\r\nside-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians.\r\nPassepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco was no longer\r\nthe legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and\r\nincendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a\r\nparadise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in\r\none hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial\r\nemporium.\r\n\r\nThe lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the\r\nstreets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the\r\nmidst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond\r\nappeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial\r\nEmpire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were\r\nrarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere\r\nworn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some\r\nof the streets—especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco\r\nwhat Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris,\r\nand Broadway to New York—were lined with splendid and spacious stores,\r\nwhich exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.\r\n\r\nWhen Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to\r\nhim as if he had left England at all.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of\r\nrestaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried\r\nbeef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their\r\npurses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was\r\ndrunk. This seemed “very American” to Passepartout. The hotel\r\nrefreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing\r\nthemselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by\r\nnegroes of darkest hue.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the\r\nEnglish consulate to have his passport _visaed_. As he was going out,\r\nhe met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before\r\ntaking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt’s\r\nrevolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains\r\nby the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but\r\ntold him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.\r\n\r\nHe had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, “by the greatest\r\nchance in the world,” he met Fix. The detective seemed wholly taken by\r\nsurprise. What! Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together,\r\nand not met on the steamer! At least Fix felt honoured to behold once\r\nmore the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his business\r\nrecalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey\r\nin such pleasant company.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective—who\r\nwas determined not to lose sight of him—begged permission to accompany\r\nthem in their walk about San Francisco—a request which Mr. Fogg readily\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThey soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd\r\nwas collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors,\r\nthe windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people. Men\r\nwere going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were\r\nfloating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Camerfield!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Mandiboy!”\r\n\r\nIt was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to\r\nMr. Fogg, “Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There may\r\nbe danger in it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Mr. Fogg; “and blows, even if they are political, are\r\nstill blows.”\r\n\r\nFix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without\r\nbeing jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a\r\nflight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street.\r\nOpposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf\r\nand a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the\r\nopen air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\r\n\r\nFor what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this\r\nexcited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate\r\nsome high official—a governor or member of Congress? It was not\r\nimprobable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All\r\nthe hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to\r\ndisappear suddenly in the midst of the cries—an energetic way, no\r\ndoubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags\r\nwavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The\r\nundulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads\r\nfloundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the\r\nblack hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to\r\nhave diminished in height.\r\n\r\n“It is evidently a meeting,” said Fix, “and its object must be an\r\nexciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the ‘Alabama,’\r\ndespite the fact that that question is settled.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied Mr. Fogg, simply.\r\n\r\n“At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the\r\nHonourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.”\r\n\r\nAouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg’s arm, observed the tumultuous scene with\r\nsurprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was.\r\nBefore the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and\r\nexcited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used\r\nas offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction. Thumps\r\nwere exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had\r\nbeen blocked up in the crowd. Boots and shoes went whirling through the\r\nair, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling\r\nin the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower\r\nstep. One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere\r\nlookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the\r\nupper hand.\r\n\r\n“It would be prudent for us to retire,” said Fix, who was anxious that\r\nMr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to\r\nLondon. “If there is any question about England in all this, and we\r\nwere recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.”\r\n\r\n“An English subject—” began Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the\r\nterrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were\r\nfrantic shouts of, “Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!”\r\n\r\nIt was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and\r\ntaking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found\r\nthemselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. The torrent of\r\nmen, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. Phileas Fogg\r\nand Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair\r\ncompanion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with\r\nthe weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman’s\r\narm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face,\r\nand broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his\r\nclenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing\r\nblow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous\r\nbruise immediately made its appearance under the detective’s silk hat,\r\nwhich was completely smashed in.\r\n\r\n“Yankee!” exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the\r\nruffian.\r\n\r\n“Englishman!” returned the other. “We will meet again!”\r\n\r\n“When you please.”\r\n\r\n“What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Phileas Fogg. And yours?”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Stamp Proctor.”\r\n\r\nThe human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got\r\nupon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily, he was not\r\nseriously hurt. His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal\r\nparts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit\r\nless compactly than they are easy to put on. Aouda had escaped\r\nunharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue\r\nbruise.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\n“No thanks are necessary,” replied Fix; “but let us go.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“To a tailor’s.”\r\n\r\nSuch a visit was, indeed, opportune. The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and\r\nFix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the\r\ncontest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour after, they were once\r\nmore suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nPassepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen\r\nsix-barrelled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but\r\nAouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his\r\ncountenance resumed its placid expression. Fix evidently was no longer\r\nan enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.\r\n\r\nDinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their\r\nluggage to the station drew up to the door. As he was getting in, Mr.\r\nFogg said to Fix, “You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I will come back to America to find him,” said Phileas Fogg calmly.\r\n“It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be\r\ntreated in that way, without retaliating.”\r\n\r\nThe detective smiled, but did not reply. It was clear that Mr. Fogg was\r\none of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at\r\nhome, fight abroad when their honour is attacked.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found\r\nthe train ready to depart. As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg called\r\na porter, and said to him: “My friend, was there not some trouble\r\nto-day in San Francisco?”\r\n\r\n“It was a political meeting, sir,” replied the porter.\r\n\r\n“But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets.”\r\n\r\n“It was only a meeting assembled for an election.”\r\n\r\n“The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?” asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; of a justice of the peace.”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed."
