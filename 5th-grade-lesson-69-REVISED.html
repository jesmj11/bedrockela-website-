      "text": "REASON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for an\r\nhour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred miles\r\nfrom San Francisco. From this point it took an easterly direction\r\ntowards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains. It was in the section included\r\nbetween this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers\r\nfound the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the\r\ngovernment granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile,\r\ninstead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains.\r\nBut the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its\r\ndifficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks. One\r\ntunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to\r\narrive at the great basin.\r\n\r\nThe track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the\r\nGreat Salt Lake. From this point it described a long curve, descending\r\ntowards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the\r\nwaters between the Atlantic and the Pacific. There were many creeks in\r\nthis mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek,\r\nGreen Creek, and others, upon culverts.\r\n\r\nPassepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix\r\nlonged to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than\r\nPhileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents,\r\nand set foot on English soil.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, and\r\ntwenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of\r\nBitter Creek throughout. The next day, 7th December, they stopped for a\r\nquarter of an hour at Green River station. Snow had fallen abundantly\r\nduring the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and\r\ndid not interrupt their progress. The bad weather, however, annoyed\r\nPassepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of\r\nthe cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg’s tour.\r\n\r\n“What an idea!” he said to himself. “Why did my master make this\r\njourney in winter? Couldn’t he have waited for the good season to\r\nincrease his chances?”\r\n\r\nWhile the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the\r\ndepression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a\r\ntotally different cause.\r\n\r\nSeveral passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and\r\ndown the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp\r\nProctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San\r\nFrancisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew\r\nback from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was\r\nattached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of\r\nthe most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth\r\nof the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she\r\ncalled gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was\r\nreally more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognised\r\nthe man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for\r\nhis conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on\r\nthis train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards,\r\nthat Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.\r\n\r\nAouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and\r\nPassepartout whom she had seen.\r\n\r\n“That Proctor on this train!” cried Fix. “Well, reassure yourself,\r\nmadam; before he settles with Mr. Fogg; he has got to deal with me! It\r\nseems to me that I was the more insulted of the two.”\r\n\r\n“And, besides,” added Passepartout, “I’ll take charge of him, colonel\r\nas he is.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fix,” resumed Aouda, “Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him. He\r\nsaid that he would come back to America to find this man. Should he\r\nperceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which might\r\nhave terrible results. He must not see him.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, madam,” replied Fix; “a meeting between them might ruin\r\nall. Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg would be delayed,\r\nand—”\r\n\r\n“And,” added Passepartout, “that would play the game of the gentlemen\r\nof the Reform Club. In four days we shall be in New York. Well, if my\r\nmaster does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope that\r\nchance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American.\r\nWe must, if possible, prevent his stirring out of it.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation dropped. Mr. Fogg had just woke up, and was looking\r\nout of the window. Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by his\r\nmaster or Aouda, whispered to the detective, “Would you really fight\r\nfor him?”\r\n\r\n“I would do anything,” replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determined\r\nwill, “to get him back living to Europe!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but\r\nhis confidence in his master remained unbroken.\r\n\r\nWas there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a\r\nmeeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a difficult\r\ntask, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.\r\nThe detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few\r\nmoments, he said to Mr. Fogg, “These are long and slow hours, sir, that\r\nwe are passing on the railway.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Mr. Fogg; “but they pass.”\r\n\r\n“You were in the habit of playing whist,” resumed Fix, “on the\r\nsteamers.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here. I have neither cards nor\r\npartners.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the\r\nAmerican trains. And as for partners, if madam plays—”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir,” Aouda quickly replied; “I understand whist. It is\r\npart of an English education.”\r\n\r\n“I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well, here are\r\nthree of us, and a dummy—”\r\n\r\n“As you please, sir,” replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his\r\nfavourite pastime even on the railway.\r\n\r\nPassepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned\r\nwith two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nThe game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even\r\nreceived some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As for the\r\ndetective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against\r\nhis present opponent.\r\n\r\n“Now,” thought Passepartout, “we’ve got him. He won’t budge.”\r\n\r\nAt eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of\r\nthe waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by\r\nthe track in crossing the Rocky Mountains. After going about two\r\nhundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those\r\nvast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so\r\npropitious for laying the iron road.\r\n\r\nOn the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of\r\nthe North Platte River, already appeared. The whole northern and\r\neastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which\r\nis formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest\r\nbeing Laramie Peak. Between this and the railway extended vast plains,\r\nplentifully irrigated. On the right rose the lower spurs of the\r\nmountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas\r\nRiver, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort\r\nHalleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky\r\nMountains were crossed. There was reason to hope, then, that no\r\naccident would mark the journey through this difficult country. The\r\nsnow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold. Large\r\nbirds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance.\r\nNo wild beast appeared on the plain. It was a desert in its vast\r\nnakedness.\r\n\r\nAfter a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and his\r\npartners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard,\r\nand the train stopped. Passepartout put his head out of the door, but\r\nsaw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.\r\n\r\nAouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get\r\nout; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant,\r\n“See what is the matter.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout rushed out of the car. Thirty or forty passengers had\r\nalready descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.\r\n\r\nThe train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way. The\r\nengineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom\r\nthe station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent\r\non before. The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion,\r\nin which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, “No! you\r\ncan’t pass. The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear the\r\nweight of the train.”\r\n\r\nThis was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from\r\nthe place where they now were. According to the signal-man, it was in a\r\nruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was\r\nimpossible to risk the passage. He did not in any way exaggerate the\r\ncondition of the bridge. It may be taken for granted that, rash as the\r\nAmericans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,\r\nlistened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.\r\n\r\n“Hum!” cried Colonel Proctor; “but we are not going to stay here, I\r\nimagine, and take root in the snow?”\r\n\r\n“Colonel,” replied the conductor, “we have telegraphed to Omaha for a\r\ntrain, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less\r\nthan six hours.”\r\n\r\n“Six hours!” cried Passepartout.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” returned the conductor, “besides, it will take us as long\r\nas that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.”\r\n\r\n“But it is only a mile from here,” said one of the passengers.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it’s on the other side of the river.”\r\n\r\n“And can’t we cross that in a boat?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“That’s impossible. The creek is swelled by the rains. It is a rapid,\r\nand we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a\r\nford.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company\r\nand the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not\r\ndisinclined to make common cause with him. Here was an obstacle,\r\nindeed, which all his master’s banknotes could not remove.\r\n\r\nThere was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without\r\nreckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles\r\nover a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and protested, and would\r\ncertainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg’s attention if he had not\r\nbeen completely absorbed in his game.\r\n\r\nPassepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had\r\noccurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when\r\nthe engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, “Gentlemen,\r\nperhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.”\r\n\r\n“On the bridge?” asked a passenger.\r\n\r\n“On the bridge.”\r\n\r\n“With our train?”\r\n\r\n“With our train.”\r\n\r\nPassepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But the bridge is unsafe,” urged the conductor.\r\n\r\n“No matter,” replied Forster; “I think that by putting on the very\r\nhighest speed we might have a chance of getting over.”\r\n\r\n“The devil!” muttered Passepartout.\r\n\r\nBut a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer’s\r\nproposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the\r\nplan a very feasible one. He told stories about engineers leaping their\r\ntrains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many\r\nof those present avowed themselves of the engineer’s mind.\r\n\r\n“We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,” said one.\r\n\r\n“Eighty! ninety!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to\r\nget over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too\r\nAmerican. “Besides,” thought he, “there’s a still more simple way, and\r\nit does not even occur to any of these people! Sir,” said he aloud to\r\none of the passengers, “the engineer’s plan seems to me a little\r\ndangerous, but—”\r\n\r\n“Eighty chances!” replied the passenger, turning his back on him.\r\n\r\n“I know it,” said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, “but a\r\nsimple idea—”\r\n\r\n“Ideas are no use,” returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, “as\r\nthe engineer assures us that we can pass.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” urged Passepartout, “we can pass, but perhaps it would be\r\nmore prudent—”\r\n\r\n“What! Prudent!” cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to excite\r\nprodigiously. “At full speed, don’t you see, at full speed!”\r\n\r\n“I know—I see,” repeated Passepartout; “but it would be, if not more\r\nprudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural—”\r\n\r\n“Who! What! What’s the matter with this fellow?” cried several.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.\r\n\r\n“Are you afraid?” asked Colonel Proctor.\r\n\r\n“I afraid? Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be\r\nas American as they!”\r\n\r\n“All aboard!” cried the conductor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, all aboard!” repeated Passepartout, and immediately. “But they\r\ncan’t prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to\r\ncross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!”\r\n\r\nBut no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have\r\nacknowledged its justice. The passengers resumed their places in the\r\ncars. Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed. The\r\nwhist-players were quite absorbed in their game.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,\r\nbacked the train for nearly a mile—retiring, like a jumper, in order to\r\ntake a longer leap. Then, with another whistle, he began to move\r\nforward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became\r\nfrightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston\r\nworked up and down twenty strokes to the second. They perceived that\r\nthe whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,\r\nhardly bore upon the rails at all.\r\n\r\nAnd they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge. The\r\ntrain leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer\r\ncould not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station. But\r\nscarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely\r\nruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow."
