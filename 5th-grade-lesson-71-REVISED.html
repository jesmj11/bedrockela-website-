      "text": "PHILEAS FOGG\r\n\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time. Passepartout, the\r\ninvoluntary cause of this delay, was desperate. He had ruined his\r\nmaster!\r\n\r\nAt this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him\r\nintently in the face, said:\r\n\r\n“Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?”\r\n\r\n“Quite seriously.”\r\n\r\n“I have a purpose in asking,” resumed Fix. “Is it absolutely necessary\r\nthat you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o’clock in the\r\nevening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?”\r\n\r\n“It is absolutely necessary.”\r\n\r\n“And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you\r\nwould have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.”\r\n\r\n“Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind. Twelve from twenty leaves\r\neight. You must regain eight hours. Do you wish to try to do so?”\r\n\r\n“On foot?” asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“No; on a sledge,” replied Fix. “On a sledge with sails. A man has\r\nproposed such a method to me.”\r\n\r\nIt was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer\r\nhe had refused.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the\r\nman, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went\r\nup to him. An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was\r\nMudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.\r\n\r\nThere Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long\r\nbeams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon\r\nwhich there was room for five or six persons. A high mast was fixed on\r\nthe frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a\r\nlarge brigantine sail. This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist\r\na jib-sail. Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle. It\r\nwas, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when\r\nthe trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely\r\nrapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.\r\nProvided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,\r\nthey slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not\r\nsuperior to that of the express trains.\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft. The\r\nwind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west. The snow\r\nhad hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport\r\nMr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha. Thence the trains eastward run\r\nfrequently to Chicago and New York. It was not impossible that the lost\r\ntime might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the\r\nopen air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort\r\nKearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a\r\nbetter route and under more favourable conditions. But Aouda refused to\r\nseparate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her\r\ndecision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to guess the detective’s thoughts. Was this\r\nconviction shaken by Phileas Fogg’s return, or did he still regard him\r\nas an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world\r\ncompleted, would think himself absolutely safe in England? Perhaps\r\nFix’s opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was\r\nnevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the\r\nwhole party to England as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock the sledge was ready to start. The passengers took\r\ntheir places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their\r\ntravelling-cloaks. The two great sails were hoisted, and under the\r\npressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a\r\nvelocity of forty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at\r\nmost two hundred miles. If the wind held good, the distance might be\r\ntraversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach\r\nOmaha by one o’clock.\r\n\r\nWhat a journey! The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak\r\nfor the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were going. The\r\nsledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves. When the breeze\r\ncame skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground\r\nby its sails. Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line,\r\nand by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a\r\ntendency to make. All the sails were up, and the jib was so arranged as\r\nnot to screen the brigantine. A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib,\r\nheld out to the wind, added its force to the other sails. Although the\r\nspeed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge could not be going at\r\nless than forty miles an hour.\r\n\r\n“If nothing breaks,” said Mudge, “we shall get there!”\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg had made it for Mudge’s interest to reach Omaha within the\r\ntime agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward.\r\n\r\nThe prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was\r\nas flat as a sea. It seemed like a vast frozen lake. The railroad which\r\nran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west\r\nby Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town, Schuyler, and\r\nFremont, to Omaha. It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte\r\nRiver. The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc\r\ndescribed by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the\r\nPlatte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of\r\nobstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident to\r\nthe sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\r\n\r\nBut the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the\r\nmast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. These\r\nlashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if\r\nvibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst of a\r\nplaintively intense melody.\r\n\r\n“Those chords give the fifth and the octave,” said Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\nThese were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, cosily\r\npacked in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the\r\nattacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his face was as red\r\nas the sun’s disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled\r\nthe biting air. With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope\r\nagain. They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning,\r\nof the 11th, and there were still some chances that it would be before\r\nthe steamer sailed for Liverpool.\r\n\r\nPassepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the\r\nhand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,\r\nthe only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some\r\npresentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however,\r\nPassepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr.\r\nFogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux. Mr.\r\nFogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never\r\nforget that!\r\n\r\nWhile each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the\r\nsledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks it passed\r\nover were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared under the\r\nuniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. Between the Union\r\nPacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it\r\nformed a great uninhabited island. Neither village, station, nor fort\r\nappeared. From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose\r\nwhite skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of\r\nwild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves\r\nran howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held\r\nhimself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an accident\r\nthen happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts,\r\nwould have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even\r\ncourse, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band\r\nat a safe distance behind.\r\n\r\nAbout noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing\r\nthe Platte River. He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now\r\nwithin twenty miles of Omaha. In less than an hour he left the rudder\r\nand furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great\r\nimpetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its\r\nsails unspread.\r\n\r\nIt stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white with\r\nsnow, said: “We have got there!”\r\n\r\nArrived! Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, by\r\nnumerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!\r\n\r\nPassepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs, and\r\naided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge. Phileas\r\nFogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped,\r\nand the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important\r\nNebraska town. Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock\r\nIsland Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty stations.\r\n\r\nA train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the\r\nstation, and they only had time to get into the cars. They had seen\r\nnothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was\r\nnot to be regretted, as they were not travelling to see the sights.\r\n\r\nThe train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa, by Council Bluffs,\r\nDes Moines, and Iowa City. During the night it crossed the Mississippi\r\nat Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois. The next day, which\r\nwas the 10th, at four o’clock in the evening, it reached Chicago,\r\nalready risen from its ruins, and more proudly seated than ever on the\r\nborders of its beautiful Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nNine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are not\r\nwanting at Chicago. Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other, and\r\nthe locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway left\r\nat full speed, as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no\r\ntime to lose. It traversed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey\r\nlike a flash, rushing through towns with antique names, some of which\r\nhad streets and car-tracks, but as yet no houses. At last the Hudson\r\ncame into view; and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the\r\n11th, the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river,\r\nbefore the very pier of the Cunard line.\r\n\r\nThe “China,” for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour\r\nbefore!"
