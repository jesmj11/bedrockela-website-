      "title": "Chapter 34: IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON",
      "text": "Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom House,\r\nand he was to be transferred to London the next day.\r\n\r\nPassepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon\r\nFix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was\r\nthunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not\r\nunderstand. Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest\r\nand courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young woman’s heart\r\nrevolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could\r\nattempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nAs for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether\r\nMr. Fogg were guilty or not.\r\n\r\nThe thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new\r\nmisfortune! Had he not concealed Fix’s errand from his master? When Fix\r\nrevealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg?\r\nIf the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof\r\nof his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would\r\nnot have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his\r\nmaster, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil.\r\nPassepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the\r\nCustom House. Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to\r\nsee Mr. Fogg again.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was\r\nabout to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having arrived at\r\nLiverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he\r\nhad till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club,\r\nthat is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London\r\nwas six hours.\r\n\r\nIf anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have\r\nfound Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger,\r\nupon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last\r\nblow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion. Was\r\nhe being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible\r\nbecause contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible\r\nforce, at the last moment? No one could tell. There he sat, calmly\r\nwaiting—for what? Did he still cherish hope? Did he still believe, now\r\nthat the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would\r\nsucceed?\r\n\r\nHowever that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the\r\ntable, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped his lips,\r\nbut his look was singularly set and stern. The situation, in any event,\r\nwas a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was\r\nhonest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.\r\n\r\nDid escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were any\r\npracticable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping from it?\r\nPossibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. But the door was\r\nlocked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He sat down\r\nagain, and drew his journal from his pocket. On the line where these\r\nwords were written, “21st December, Saturday, Liverpool,” he added,\r\n“80th day, 11.40 a.m.,” and waited.\r\n\r\nThe Custom House clock struck one. Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was\r\ntwo hours too fast.\r\n\r\nTwo hours! Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express\r\ntrain, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before\r\nnine, p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside,\r\nthen a hasty opening of doors. Passepartout’s voice was audible, and\r\nimmediately after that of Fix. Phileas Fogg’s eyes brightened for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, who\r\nhurried towards him.\r\n\r\nFix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder. He could not\r\nspeak. “Sir,” he stammered, “sir—forgive me—most—unfortunate\r\nresemblance—robber arrested three days ago—you are free!”\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg was free! He walked to the detective, looked him steadily\r\nin the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his\r\nlife, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with the\r\nprecision of a machine knocked Fix down.\r\n\r\n“Well hit!” cried Passepartout, “Parbleu! that’s what you might call a\r\ngood application of English fists!”\r\n\r\nFix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word. He had only\r\nreceived his deserts. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout left the Custom\r\nHouse without delay, got into a cab, and in a few moments descended at\r\nthe station.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for\r\nLondon. It was forty minutes past two. The express train had left\r\nthirty-five minutes before. Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.\r\n\r\nThere were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway\r\narrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nAt that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by the offer\r\nof a generous reward, at last set out towards London with Aouda and his\r\nfaithful servant.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and this\r\nwould have been easy on a clear road throughout. But there were forced\r\ndelays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus, all\r\nthe clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made the tour of the world, he was behind-hand five minutes. He\r\nhad lost the wager!\r\n\r\n [1] A somewhat remarkable eccentricity on the part of the London\r\n clocks!—TRANSLATOR."
