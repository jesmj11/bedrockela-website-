      "title": "Chapter 36: IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG’S NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON ’CHANGE",
      "text": "It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion\r\nwhen it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain James Strand,\r\nhad been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at Edinburgh. Three\r\ndays before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, who was being\r\ndesperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable\r\ngentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had\r\nlaid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, as if by magic;\r\nthe “Phileas Fogg bonds” again became negotiable, and many new wagers\r\nwere made. Phileas Fogg’s name was once more at a premium on ’Change.\r\n\r\nHis five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state\r\nof feverish suspense. Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had forgotten,\r\nreappear before their eyes! Where was he at this moment? The 17th of\r\nDecember, the day of James Strand’s arrest, was the seventy-sixth since\r\nPhileas Fogg’s departure, and no news of him had been received. Was he\r\ndead? Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey\r\nalong the route agreed upon? And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st\r\nof December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold\r\nof the Reform Club saloon?\r\n\r\nThe anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, cannot be\r\ndescribed. Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas\r\nFogg. Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning\r\nand evening. No news. The police were ignorant what had become of the\r\ndetective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent.\r\nBets increased, nevertheless, in number and value. Phileas Fogg, like a\r\nracehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point. The bonds were\r\nquoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at\r\nfive; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.\r\n\r\nA great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets\r\non Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently\r\nestablished around the Reform Club. Circulation was impeded, and\r\neverywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were going\r\non. The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and as\r\nthe hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose to\r\nits highest pitch.\r\n\r\nThe five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the\r\nclub. John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, the bankers, Andrew Stuart,\r\nthe engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the Bank of England, and\r\nThomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all waited anxiously.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart got\r\nup, saying, “Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between\r\nMr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.”\r\n\r\n“What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?” asked Thomas\r\nFlanagan.\r\n\r\n“At twenty-three minutes past seven,” replied Gauthier Ralph; “and the\r\nnext does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve.”\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen,” resumed Andrew Stuart, “if Phileas Fogg had come in\r\nthe 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time. We can, therefore,\r\nregard the bet as won.”\r\n\r\n“Wait; don’t let us be too hasty,” replied Samuel Fallentin. “You know\r\nthat Mr. Fogg is very eccentric. His punctuality is well known; he\r\nnever arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not be surprised if\r\nhe appeared before us at the last minute.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Andrew Stuart nervously, “if I should see him, I should not\r\nbelieve it was he.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” resumed Thomas Flanagan, “Mr. Fogg’s project was\r\nabsurdly foolish. Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent the\r\ndelays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three\r\ndays would be fatal to his tour.”\r\n\r\n“Observe, too,” added John Sullivan, “that we have received no\r\nintelligence from him, though there are telegraphic lines all along his\r\nroute.”\r\n\r\n“He has lost, gentleman,” said Andrew Stuart, “he has a hundred times\r\nlost! You know, besides, that the ‘China’—the only steamer he could\r\nhave taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday. I have\r\nseen a list of the passengers, and the name of Phileas Fogg is not\r\namong them. Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him, he can\r\nscarcely have reached America. I think he will be at least twenty days\r\nbehind-hand, and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand.”\r\n\r\n“It is clear,” replied Gauthier Ralph; “and we have nothing to do but\r\nto present Mr. Fogg’s cheque at Barings to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes\r\nto nine.\r\n\r\n“Five minutes more,” said Andrew Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe five gentlemen looked at each other. Their anxiety was becoming\r\nintense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily assented to Mr.\r\nFallentin’s proposal of a rubber.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t give up my four thousand of the bet,” said Andrew Stuart,\r\nas he took his seat, “for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine.”\r\n\r\nThe clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine.\r\n\r\nThe players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes off the\r\nclock. Certainly, however secure they felt, minutes had never seemed so\r\nlong to them!\r\n\r\n“Seventeen minutes to nine,” said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the cards\r\nwhich Ralph handed to him.\r\n\r\nThen there was a moment of silence. The great saloon was perfectly\r\nquiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now and\r\nthen a shrill cry. The pendulum beat the seconds, which each player\r\neagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity.\r\n\r\n“Sixteen minutes to nine!” said John Sullivan, in a voice which\r\nbetrayed his emotion.\r\n\r\nOne minute more, and the wager would be won. Andrew Stuart and his\r\npartners suspended their game. They left their cards, and counted the\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAt the fortieth second, nothing. At the fiftieth, still nothing.\r\n\r\nAt the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed by\r\napplause, hurrahs, and some fierce growls.\r\n\r\nThe players rose from their seats.\r\n\r\nAt the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; and the\r\npendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg appeared,\r\nfollowed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club\r\ndoors, and in his calm voice, said, “Here I am, gentlemen!”"
