      "text": "AROUND THE WORLD, UNLESS IT WERE HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nYes; Phileas Fogg in person.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the\r\nevening—about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers\r\nin London—Passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the\r\nservices of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriage ceremony,\r\nwhich was to take place the next day.\r\n\r\nPassepartout went on his errand enchanted. He soon reached the\r\nclergyman’s house, but found him not at home. Passepartout waited a\r\ngood twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend gentleman, it was\r\nthirty-five minutes past eight. But in what a state he was! With his\r\nhair in disorder, and without his hat, he ran along the street as never\r\nman was seen to run before, overturning passers-by, rushing over the\r\nsidewalk like a waterspout.\r\n\r\nIn three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered back into\r\nMr. Fogg’s room.\r\n\r\nHe could not speak.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“My master!” gasped Passepartout—“marriage—impossible—”\r\n\r\n“Impossible?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible—for to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because to-morrow—is Sunday!”\r\n\r\n“Monday,” replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n\r\n“No—to-day is Saturday.”\r\n\r\n“Saturday? Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes, yes!” cried Passepartout. “You have made a mistake of\r\none day! We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only\r\nten minutes left!”\r\n\r\nPassepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was dragging him\r\nalong with irresistible force.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, left his\r\nhouse, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to the cabman, and,\r\nhaving run over two dogs and overturned five carriages, reached the\r\nReform Club.\r\n\r\nThe clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great\r\nsaloon.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty\r\ndays!\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!\r\n\r\nHow was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this\r\nerror of a day? How came he to think that he had arrived in London on\r\nSaturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was really Friday,\r\nthe twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?\r\n\r\nThe cause of the error is very simple.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his journey,\r\nand this merely because he had travelled constantly _eastward;_ he\r\nwould, on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone in the opposite\r\ndirection, that is, _westward_.\r\n\r\nIn journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days\r\ntherefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed\r\ndegrees in this direction. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on\r\nthe circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty\r\ndegrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four\r\nhours—that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while\r\nPhileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian _eighty_\r\ntimes, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian\r\n_seventy-nine_ times. This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club\r\non Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought.\r\n\r\nAnd Passepartout’s famous family watch, which had always kept London\r\ntime, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the days as well\r\nas the hours and the minutes!\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as he had\r\nspent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary gain was\r\nsmall. His object was, however, to be victorious, and not to win money.\r\nHe divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout\r\nand the unfortunate Fix, against whom he cherished no grudge. He\r\ndeducted, however, from Passepartout’s share the cost of the gas which\r\nhad burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours, for the\r\nsake of regularity.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, said to\r\nAouda: “Is our marriage still agreeable to you?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fogg,” replied she, “it is for me to ask that question. You were\r\nruined, but now you are rich again.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, madam; my fortune belongs to you. If you had not suggested\r\nour marriage, my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel\r\nWilson’s, I should not have been apprised of my error, and—”\r\n\r\n“Dear Mr. Fogg!” said the young woman.\r\n\r\n“Dear Aouda!” replied Phileas Fogg.\r\n\r\nIt need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours\r\nafter, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave the bride\r\naway. Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?\r\n\r\nThe next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped vigorously\r\nat his master’s door. Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, “What’s the\r\nmatter, Passepartout?”\r\n\r\n“What is it, sir? Why, I’ve just this instant found out—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eight\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” returned Mr. Fogg, “by not crossing India. But if I had not\r\ncrossed India, I should not have saved Aouda; she would not have been\r\nmy wife, and—”\r\n\r\nMr. Fogg quietly shut the door.\r\n\r\nPhileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around the\r\nworld in eighty days. To do this he had employed every means of\r\nconveyance—steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels,\r\nsledges, elephants. The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed\r\nall his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude. But what then?\r\nWhat had he really gained by all this trouble? What had he brought back\r\nfrom this long and weary journey?\r\n\r\nNothing, say you? Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, who,\r\nstrange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men!\r\n\r\nTruly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?"
