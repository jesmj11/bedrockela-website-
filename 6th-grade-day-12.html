          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXII</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXII</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,
chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out
a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way
in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon
found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire
grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display
himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth
of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had
worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old
Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed
and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition
and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that
he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the
looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.
At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was
disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation
at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom
resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,
however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but
found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he
could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he
abandoned it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy
for two days.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man
in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not
twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
made of rag carpeting—admission, three pins for boys, two for girls—and
then circusing was abandoned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village
duller and drearier than ever.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
cancer for permanency and pain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Then came the measles.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and
everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and
girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe
Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn
and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head
with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for
he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.
He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have
seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from
under an insect like himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
second was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Tom—had suffered a relapse.</p>

        <div class="chapter-section" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXIII</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">At last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience
and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.
He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some
relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself
that Huck had remained discreet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“’Bout what?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You know what.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh—’course I haven’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Never a word?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I was afeard.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out.
_You_ know that.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep
mum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I’m agreed.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What is the talk around, Huck? I’ve heard a power of it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Talk? Well, it’s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner.
Don’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever
done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to
get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of
good—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and
lots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.
I wish we could get him out of there.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good;
they’d ketch him again.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens
when he never done—that.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain
in this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he
was to get free they’d lynch him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“And they’d do it, too.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and
gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and
there were no guards.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town.
And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used
to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good
fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve
all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck
don’t—_they_ don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well,
boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only
way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.
Right, and _best_, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk
about that. I don’t want to make _you_ feel bad; you’ve befriended me.
But what I want to say, is, don’t _you_ ever get drunk—then you won’t
ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime
comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck
of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly
faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me
touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but
mine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Muff Potter a
power, and they’d help him more if they could.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an
almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.
Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
that Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was
not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He
was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for
this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Take the witness.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
his own counsel said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I have no questions to ask him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
Counsel for the prosecution said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Take the witness.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s
possession.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Take the witness.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
client’s life without an effort?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand
without being cross-questioned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
by Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
Counsel for the prosecution now said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned
in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion
testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then
to the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
Potter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as
he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,
for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
hour of midnight?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“In the graveyard!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“In the graveyard.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, sir.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Near as I am to you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Were you hidden, or not?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I was hid.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Where?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Any one with you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, sir. I went there with—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We
will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.
What did you take there?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Only a—a—dead cat.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything,
and don’t be afraid.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
emotion reached its climax when the boy said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun
Joe jumped with the knife and—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his
way through all opposers, and was gone!</p>

          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXIV</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the
young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
if he escaped hanging.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
of conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
Injun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
that? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Daily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
craft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t
hang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through
and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.</p>
