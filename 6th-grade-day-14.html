          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXVIII</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or
left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck
was to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s
old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
lantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)
were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the
alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,
the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
distant thunder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was
a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a
mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it
would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
tearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm
burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly
get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.
Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
open comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
towel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What!—what’d you see, Tom?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
started!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see
the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“How?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have
got a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But
say, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s
drunk.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It is, that! You try it!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck shuddered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, no—I reckon not.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t
enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Joe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll
snatch that box quicker’n lightning.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every
night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
and that’ll fetch me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Agreed, and good as wheat!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for
a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,
Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as
if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But
you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry
he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t
come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,
just skip right around and maow.”</p>

        <div class="chapter-section" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXIX</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
news—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.
Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”
 with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more
moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s
“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was
ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
Thatcher said to Becky, was:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll
climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have
ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be
awful glad to have us.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, that will be fun!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“But what will mamma say?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“How’ll she ever know?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she
wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if
she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to
Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he
give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so
why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Who’s ready for the cave?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood
unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled
by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was
romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the
situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went
filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of
lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than
eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a
vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again
and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was
an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
“known” ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking
no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went
glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not
stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were
put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under
his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.
Why call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box
and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow
them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So
communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the
men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
ahead not to be invisible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up
a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the
path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old
Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still
climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.
But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.
They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and
were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his
distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an
owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was
everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his
throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’
grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard
to find.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I can’t see any.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A
deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His
thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been
kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder
her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t
dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in
the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s
next—which was—</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you
before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was
rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice
of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t
a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in
front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on!
_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But
I’ll take it out of _her_.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was
here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t
kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her
ears like a sow!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“By God, that’s—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her
to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if
she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s
why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.
Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and
then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the
better—I’m all in a shiver.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,
first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no
hurry.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig
snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he
turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, who are you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!
But let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got
in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends
to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you
won’t ever say it was me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”
 exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and
then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
fast as his legs could carry him.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="chapter-section" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXX</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXX</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The
inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,
on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a
window:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Who’s there!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">These were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest
he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
sons speedily dressed themselves.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be
ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make
yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop
here last night.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols
went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted
to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t
want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but
there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they
ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that
sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the
meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to
come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when
the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,
I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling
was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.
They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by
and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet
we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a
posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it
is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys
will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of
those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they
were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or
twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back
of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and
tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
sprang up and exclaimed:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
please!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what
you did.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing
it, sure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
suspicious?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and
I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account
of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of
doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I
come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one
wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a
rusty, ragged-looking devil.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Then they went on, and you—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked
along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and
heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d
spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,
and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,
but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.
Presently the Welshman said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for
all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is
not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t
cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want
to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t
betray you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a
different matter altogether.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Of _what_?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring
wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman
started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what
did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have
given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested
itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless
reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered
it—feebly:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sunday-school books, maybe.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and
ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a man’s pocket, because
it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder
you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.
Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and
Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news
had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me
to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
widow said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come
again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
to death.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Your Becky?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, no.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy
that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to
settle with him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No’m.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“When did you see him last?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously
questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed
whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One
young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.”
 Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,
and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The
Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.
He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and
crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither
and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their
hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,
far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &
TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and
near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever
have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away
speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst
forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a
sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;
it was only a searcher’s light.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly
dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
Tavern since he had been ill.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes,” said the widow.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What? What was it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you
did give me!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer
that found it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you
before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone
forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
cry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope
enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”</p>
