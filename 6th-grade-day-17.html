          <div class="reading-passage" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05em; max-height: 600px; overflow-y: auto; padding: 20px; background: #f9f9f9; border-radius: 8px;">
            
        <div class="chapter-section" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXXIII</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore
Judge Thatcher.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary
time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could
find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner
had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a
few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The
poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded
by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off
the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had
scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once
in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a
dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling
when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the
British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
“news.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall
have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,
and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a
purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it
another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped
out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist
stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when
he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands
first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”
 cannot rival it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and
all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the
governor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water-works.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the
Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
to talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben
you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always
told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern
was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you
was to watch there that night?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“_You_ followed him?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and
I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t
ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever
nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways
it’s a goner for us, Tom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on
the track of that money again?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, it’s in the cave!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck’s eyes blazed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say it again, Tom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“The money’s in the cave!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in
there with me and help get it out?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll
agree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,
by jings.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
now, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
but there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know
about. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff
down there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever
turn your hand over.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Less start right off, Tom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled
things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I
had some when I was in there before.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
below “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s
one of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">They landed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.
You just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,
but I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll
let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a
Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it
sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“And kill them?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s a ransom?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after
you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s
the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,
but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully
scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat
off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see
that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve
been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that
you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right
around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses
and all that.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then
made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought
them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.
He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay
against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame
struggle and expire.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the
“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high. Tom whispered:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He held his candle aloft and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the
big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s
where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, less git out of here!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What! and leave the treasure?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he
died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
ghosts, and so do you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.
But presently an idea occurred to him—</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s
ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The point was well taken. It had its effect.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that
cross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
vain. Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
ground.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s
that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in
the clay.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed
to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
exclaimed:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
well soaked with the water-drip.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
his hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but
we _have_ got it, sure! Say—let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it
out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day
at the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
fetching the little bags along.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
rock.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we
go to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our
orgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What orgies?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to
have them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s
getting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get
to the skiff.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s
woodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,
and then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be
safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook
Benny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s
house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the
Welshman stepped out and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hallo, who’s that?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as
light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Old metal,” said Tom.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s
human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely
accused:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The Welshman laughed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you
and the widow good friends?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">This question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.
Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They
were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">She took them to a bedchamber and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no
thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both
of you. Get into them. We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up
enough.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Then she left.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER XXXIV</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huck said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t
high from the ground.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t
going down there, Tom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of
you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Sid appeared.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary
got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody’s been fretting about you.
Say—ain’t this grease and clay, on your clothes?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist ’tend to your own business. What’s all this
blowout about, anyway?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s one of the widow’s parties that she’s always having. This time
it’s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night. And say—I can tell you something, if
you want to know.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, what?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
secret, but I reckon it’s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows—the
widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound
Huck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without
Huck, you know!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Secret about what, Sid?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was
going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
pretty flat.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sid, was it you that told?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told—that’s enough.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
that’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the
hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean
things, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
There—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped
him to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you
dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Some minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a
dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
another person whose modesty—</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in
the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,
the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot
the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze
and everybody’s laudations.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
business in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.
Oh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest—and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, there ain’t ever any
making of that boy out. I never—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly
did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“There—what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said
he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
don’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m
willing to allow.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property.</p>
