          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER I</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER I</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">No answer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“TOM!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">No answer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">No answer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were
her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not
service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.
She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I never did see the beat of that boy!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Y-o-u-u TOM!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in
there?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Nothing.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that
truck?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I don’t know, aunt.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you
didn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“My! Look behind you, aunt!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.
The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long
he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and
I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s
the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as
the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I
know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead
sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,
and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I’ll just
be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard
to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he
hates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some
of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">[*] Southwestern for “afternoon”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood
and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning. Said she:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes’m.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes’m.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He
searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No’m—well, not very much.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
collar was securely sewed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey
and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But Sidney said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,
but it’s black.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle
carried white thread and the other black. He said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But
I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
though—and loathed him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to
do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him
the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,
unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
astronomer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger
than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply
astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time. Finally Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I can lick you!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I’d like to see you try it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I can do it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No you can’t, either.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes I can.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No you can’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I can.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You can’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Can!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Can’t!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s your name?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well I ’low I’ll _make_ it my business.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well why don’t you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“If you say much, I will.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Much—much—_much_. There now.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it
off—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’re a liar!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’re another.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Aw—take a walk!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock
off’n your head.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, of _course_ you will.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well I _will_.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will
for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I _ain’t_ afraid.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You are.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I ain’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You are.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Get away from here!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Go away yourself!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I won’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I won’t either.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can
thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger
than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”
 [Both brothers were imaginary.]</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That’s a lie.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand
up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">At last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next
time.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”
 To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.</p>

          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER II</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER II</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Jim shook his head and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water
an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine
to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own
business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.
Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever
know.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.
’Deed she would.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her
thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but
talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a
marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Jim began to waver.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful
’fraid ole missis—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was
representing a forty-foot wheel.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”
 The left hand began to describe circles.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!
Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn
round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her
go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!”
(trying the gauge-cocks).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared
a moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the
apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of
course you’d druther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What do you call work?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom
Sawyer.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The brush continued to move.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the
effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it
was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way it’s got to be done.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let
_you_, if you was me, Tom.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you
the core of my apple.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window sash.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of
whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary
to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and
wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report.</p>
