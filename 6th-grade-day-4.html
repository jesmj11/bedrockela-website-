          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER V</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER V</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_
                                                        of ease,</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_
                                                        -y seas?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;
he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not
listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular
route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s
hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of
war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything
else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested
for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the
thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,
if it was a tame lion.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It
was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off.</p>

        <div class="chapter-section" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <h3 style="color: #B06821; margin-bottom: 20px;">CHAPTER VI</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">CHAPTER VI</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But Sid slept on unconscious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">No result from Sid.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Sid snored on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course
worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
Tom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom moaned out:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No—never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this
way?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh
crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to
me. When I’m gone—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom—oh, don’t. Maybe—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to
town, and tell her—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Sid flew downstairs and said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Dying!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
bedside she gasped out:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, auntie, I’m—”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.
Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish
I may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay
home from school.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d
get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling
by the bedpost, now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled
hero.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and
delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
in the dirt when not rolled up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hello, Huckleberry!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’s that you got?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Dead cat.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Bought him off’n a boy.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What did you give?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Good for? Cure warts with.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I bet you don’t. What is it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, spunk-water.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Who told you so!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
nigger told me. There now!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
don’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks!
Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
was.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“In the daytime?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Certainly.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“With his face to the stump?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes. Least I reckon so.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Did he say anything?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all
by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a
spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the
stump and jam your hand in and say:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,
    Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner
done.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this
town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work
spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many
warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Have you? What’s your way?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you
say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.
That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and
most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see
’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk;
and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em
and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m
done with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that
very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke
his arm.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and
_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t
reckon.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me
a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you
tell.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Nothing but a tick.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Where’d you get him?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Out in the woods.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“What’ll you take for him?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m
satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted
to.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a
pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Less see it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Is it genuwyne?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
interruption roused him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Thomas Sawyer!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Sir!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
girls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind. The master said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You—you did what?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">There was no mistaking the words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
jacket.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished. Then the order followed:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him
and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The
girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt
to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Let me see it.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s nice—make a man.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, will you? When?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“I’ll stay if you will.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me
Tom, will you?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
said:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, it ain’t anything.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes it is.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You’ll tell.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed: “_I love you_.”</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
looked pleased, nevertheless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-indent: 2em;">As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but
the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months.</p>
