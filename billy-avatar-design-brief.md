## Context & Usage

### Where Billy Appears

**Primary Usage:**
- Web app chat interface (side panel)
- Next to student's writing area
- Loading screens ("Billy is thinking...")
- Success messages ("Great job!")

**Secondary Usage:**
- Marketing website (hero image, about page)
- Social media graphics
- Email newsletters
- Printed materials (worksheets, teacher guides)

### Size Considerations
- **Large (256×512px):** Marketing, hero images - full detail visible
- **Medium (64×128px):** Chat UI, profile icons - clear features
- **Small (40×60px):** Status indicators, inline mentions - must be recognizable

**Test:** At 40×40px, can you still tell it's a goat? Can you tell which emotion?

## Brand Integration

## AI Image Generation (Alternative)

If budget is tight, could try AI generation as starting point:

### Midjourney Prompts
```

standing upright, warm sage green color, simple clean design, 
expressive eyes, small horns, holding a pencil, 
style of duolingo owl meets PBS kids, 
vector illustration, white background --v 6 --style raw

/imagine the same goat character with different expressions: 
happy celebrating, thinking pondering, excited idea, 
character sheet, multiple expressions, 
consistent style, simple shapes --v 6 --style raw
```

### DALL-E 3 Prompts
```
