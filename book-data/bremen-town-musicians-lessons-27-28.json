      "text": "The robbers never came back. The four friends lived in the house. They sang all the time! HEE-HAW! WOOF! MEOW! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! They were the Bremen Town Musicians! The lesson: Friends working together can do big things! The end! Onomatopoeia = Words that sound like what they mean! Animal Sounds in This Story: - Donkey: HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW! - Dog: WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! - Cat: MEOW! MEOW! MEOW! - Rooster: COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! Other Sound Words: - CRASH! (falling through window) - Creak, creak, creak (door opening) - Munch, munch, munch (eating) Practice: What sounds do these make? - A door: SLAM! CREAK! - Eating: MUNCH! CRUNCH! - Water: SPLASH! DRIP! - Footsteps: STOMP! TAP! TIP-TOE! Initial Blends: - Bremen (br-) - friends (fr-) - stand (st-) - stomp (st-) - crept (cr-) - scare / scared (sc-) Final Blends: - roost (-st) - robbers (double consonant + blend) Practice Sentence: \"My best friends will stand and stomp to scare the robbers in Bremen!\" \"What is wrong?\" \"I have no home.\" \"Come with us! We will be musicians!\" \"HEE-HAW! WOOF! MEOW! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!\" \"They ran and ran and ran!\" 1. Who were the four animals? (donkey, dog, cat, rooster) 2. Where were they going? (Bremen Town) 3. What did they want to be? (musicians!) 4. Why were they all sad at first? (too old, no home) 5. What did they find? (a house with robbers) 6. How did they scare the robbers? (made loud music! HEE-HAW! WOOF! MEOW! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!) 7. What happened at the end? (they lived in the house together!) 8. What is the lesson? Act out the story's BEST part: - Four people (or stuffed animals!) stand on each other - (Safely! Maybe just stack toys or use your hands!) - Everyone makes their animal sound AT THE SAME TIME! - Fall down (gently!) like they crashed through the window! Lesson: Together, we can do BIG things! - Each person picks an animal - Make that animal's sound - \"Conduct\" the band: Point to each person, they make their sound! - Try it LOUD! Try it soft! Try it FAST! - You're musicians too! Animal Ideas: - Dog: WOOF! - Cat: MEOW! - Cow: MOO! - Pig: OINK! - Duck: QUACK! - Sheep: BAA! Find sound words in OTHER stories! - Billy Goats Gruff: Tap, tap, tap! Stomp, stomp, stomp! Nom, nom, nom! - Three Little Pigs: Huff, puff, WHOOSH, CRASH! - Goldilocks: Knock, knock! Creak, creak! CRACK! BOOM! Make a list! How many sound words can you find? | PROBLEM | SOLUTION | |---------|----------| | Animals have no home | They go to Bremen to be musicians | | They're hungry and tired | They find a house | | Robbers are in the house | They scare them away with music! | | Robbers might come back | Animals defend the house! | Lesson: Every problem has a solution! Work together! Put these in order: 1. Donkey meets dog 2. Dog meets cat 3. Cat meets rooster 4. They find house with robbers 5. They make music and scare robbers 6. They eat and sleep 7. Robber comes back 8. Animals scare him again! 9. They live happily in the house Each animal was: - Brave (faced the robbers!) - Helpful (helped each other) - Creative (made a plan to scare robbers) - Loyal (stuck together as friends) Talk about it: - Have YOU ever been brave? - How do YOU help your friends? - What creative ideas have YOU had? - Enormous Turnip: Everyone worked together to pull it up! - Bremen Musicians: Everyone worked together to scare robbers! - Little Red Hen: She did NOT work together (friends didn't help!) - Connection: Teamwork is powerful! Draw the four animals standing on each other: 1. Donkey on bottom (biggest) 2. Dog on donkey 3. Cat on dog 4. Rooster on top (smallest) Label each animal! Draw sound bubbles coming from their mouths! Billy the Goat says: \"Just like the four animals became musicians by practicing their sounds together, YOU become a reader by practicing your LETTER SOUNDS together! HEE-HAW is made of sounds /h/ /ē/ /h/ /aw/! When you blend sounds, you make WORDS! That's music to my ears!\" Also: The animals were all DIFFERENT (donkey, dog, cat, rooster), but together they were STRONGER! In reading, you use DIFFERENT skills together (sounds, blending, sight words) to become a STRONG reader! 1. Onomatopoeia focus: TONS of sound words! (Lesson 27 skill!) 2. Repetitive structure: Each animal joins, building pattern recognition 3. Animal sounds = phonics practice: Breaking sounds into parts 4. Blend practice: Bremen, friends, stand, stomp, crept, scared 5. Teamwork theme: Beautiful lesson about cooperation 6. FUN! Kids LOVE making animal sounds! 7. Cumulative story: Adds one animal at a time (like \"The House That Jack Built\") - Music: Animal sounds = music! Rhythm, loud/soft, conducting - Science: Animal sounds (what animals really sound like in nature?) - Social Studies: Cooperation, community, helping those in need - Character Education: Teamwork, bravery, friendship, loyalty - Drama: Perfect for acting out! - musician (someone who makes music) - onomatopoeia (words that sound like what they mean—WOOF!, CRASH!, MEOW!) - robber (someone who steals) - feast (a big, fancy meal) - roost (where a bird sleeps) - tower (tall structure—the animals stacked up!) - teamwork (working together) - Listen to animal sounds in music (Carnival of the Animals, Peter and the Wolf) - Make simple instruments (shake a box of rice = maracas!) - March like a band!
