      "text": "But the grapes were NOT sour. The grapes were sweet and yum! The fox just said that because he could not get them! The lesson: It is easy to make excuses when you cannot get what you want! The end! QU words: quick, quit, quilt, quiz X words: fox, box, six, fix, mix, taxi QU Practice Sentence: \"The quick fox did quit fast!\" X Practice Sentence: \"The fox saw six grapes in a box.\" \"Jump! Jump! Jump!\" \"I am quick, but I cannot get them.\" \"They are too sour!\" \"I did not want those grapes anyway!\" 1. What did the fox see? (grapes) 2. What did the fox want to do? (eat the grapes) 3. How many times did the fox jump? (six times!) 4. Could the fox reach the grapes? (no, too high) 5. What did the fox say about the grapes? (they're sour) 6. Were the grapes REALLY sour? (NO! They were sweet!) 7. Why did the fox SAY they were sour? (because he couldn't get them—he was making an excuse!) 8. What is the lesson of this story? This story is where the saying \"sour grapes\" comes from! \"Sour grapes\" means: Making excuses and pretending you didn't want something when you REALLY did want it but couldn't get it. Examples: - \"I didn't want to win that game anyway!\" (sour grapes!) - \"That toy is probably broken!\" (sour grapes!) - \"I didn't want to go to that party!\" (sour grapes!) Question: Have YOU ever said \"sour grapes\"? When? What the fox SHOULD have said: \"I tried my best, but I can't reach them. Maybe I need help or a ladder!\" What the fox DID say: \"I didn't want them anyway! They're sour!\" Which is better? - Being HONEST (admitting you can't do something) - Making EXCUSES (pretending you didn't want it) Talk about it: - It's OK to not be able to do something! - It's NOT OK to make excuses or lie! - Asking for HELP is better than giving up and lying! - Be the fox! - Jump and try to reach something high (grapes, or a toy on a shelf) - Count: Jump 1, jump 2, jump 3, jump 4, jump 5, jump 6! - Sit down and quit - Make a grumpy face and say, \"I didn't want it anyway!\" - Then laugh because the fox was being silly! The fox had a PROBLEM: Grapes too high What could he have done instead of quitting? - Ask a friend for help - Find a box to stand on - Get a stick to knock them down - Find a ladder - Wait for the grapes to fall Lesson: Don't give up! Find another way! - Lion & Mouse: The lion NEEDED help and got it - Fox & Grapes: The fox NEEDED help but DIDN'T ask for it—he made excuses instead! - Connection: It's OK to ask for help! Billy the Goat says: \"When reading gets hard, don't say 'I didn't want to read that book anyway!' That's SOUR GRAPES! Instead, say 'This is tricky, but I can practice and get better!' Don't make excuses—keep trying!\" Also: The fox jumped SIX times! That's X practice! When you practice reading SIX times (or more!), you get better and better! 1. QU and X focus: Perfect for these two quick-to-teach sounds 2. VERY SHORT: Can be read in 2-3 minutes (great confidence builder!) 3. Memorable lesson: \"Sour grapes\" is a saying kids will remember 4. Character attitude: Easy to discuss honesty vs. excuses 5. Relatable: Kids understand wanting something they can't have 6. Funny: The fox is silly and kids will laugh at him - Science: Grapes (fruit, vines, how they grow) - Social Studies: Honesty, making good choices - Character Education: Being honest, not making excuses, asking for help - SEL: Managing disappointment, being truthful about feelings - sour (not sweet, like a lemon) - sweet (tastes like sugar, yummy) - excuses (reasons you make up when you don't want to admit something) - quit (stop trying) - honest (telling the truth) - Bring in grapes (if possible) - Taste them: Are they sour or sweet? - Compare: lemon (sour) vs. grape (sweet) - Talk about the difference!
