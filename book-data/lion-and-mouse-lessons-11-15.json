What happened to the lion later? (got stuck in a net) 7. How did the mouse help? (chewed through the net) 8. What is the lesson of this story? The Lesson: Even the smallest person can help the biggest person! Questions: - Have you ever helped someone bigger than you? - Have you ever been helped by someone smaller? - Does size matter when it comes to kindness? - Can kids help grown-ups? How? - Lion = BIG - Mouse = LITTLE - But LITTLE mouse saved BIG lion! - Find things that are big and little - Talk about: biggest, bigger, big / littlest, littler, little | CAUSE | EFFECT | |-------|--------| | Mouse ran on lion | Lion woke up | | Lion was about to eat mouse | Mouse begged to be freed | | Lion let mouse go | Mouse was grateful | | Lion got stuck in net | Lion roared for help | | Mouse heard lion | Mouse came to help | | Mouse chewed the net | Lion got free! | | Mouse helped lion | They became best friends! | Big idea: One ACT OF KINDNESS → Another act of kindness! - One person is the big lion (use a deep voice, ROAR!) - One person is the little mouse (use a tiny voice, squeak!) - Act out the story with movements: - Lion sleeping (snore!) - Mouse running (scurry!) - Lion grabbing mouse (catch!) - Mouse begging (please!) - Lion laughing (ha ha!) - Lion stuck (pull, pull!) - Mouse nibbling (nibble nibble!) - Lion free (yay!) - Friends forever (hug!) Talk about being kind: - The lion was KIND to the mouse (let him go) - The mouse was KIND to the lion (saved him) - What KIND things can YOU do? - Has someone been kind to you? - How did it make you feel? While reading, PAUSE and ask: - \"What do you think the lion will do to the mouse?\" - \"Do you think the mouse can really help the lion? How?\" - \"What do you think will happen when the lion gets stuck?\" - \"Will the mouse remember his promise?\" - Billy Goats Gruff: Smallest goat went first, biggest saved the day - Lion & Mouse: Smallest mouse saved the biggest lion - Connection: Sometimes SMALL is MIGHTY! Billy the Goat says: \"I'm a small goat, but I can climb BIG mountains! You might be a small reader NOW, but you can read BIG books LATER! Just like the little mouse helped the big lion, YOU can do BIG things even when you're little! Never give up!\" Also: The lion LAUGHED at the mouse. But the mouse proved him wrong! Don't laugh at beginners—they might surprise you! 1. Vowel practice: All five vowels in simple CVC words 2. SHORT: Easy to read in one sitting (builds confidence!) 3. Clear moral: Kindness, everyone has value 4. Memorable: Kids LOVE this fable 5. Character voices: Fun to perform with big/tiny voices 6. Visual contrast: BIG lion vs. LITTLE mouse (easy to picture) - Science: Lions and mice (habitats, size, diet) - Social Studies: Helping others, community, friendship - Character Education: Kindness, keeping promises, not judging by size - Math: Big vs. small, comparing sizes - fable (a story that teaches a lesson) - moral (the lesson of the story) - grateful (thankful) - promise (saying you will do something and doing it) - save (help someone in danger) Story Source: Public Domain (Aesop's Fable) BedrockELA Adaptation: February 2026 For use with: BedrockELA 1st Grade Curriculum, Lessons 11-15 Focus Skills: All five vowels (a,e,i,o,u), kindness theme, cause & effect, size concepts Story Type: Fable (teaches a lesson) Perfect for: Teaching that everyone—no matter how small—has value and can help!",
