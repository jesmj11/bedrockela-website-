    "text": "CHAPTER I\r\nTHE INDIAN OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second part of our journey under the sea. The first\r\nended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a\r\ndeep impression on my mind. Thus, in the midst of this great sea,\r\nCaptain Nemo’s life was passing, even to his grave, which he had\r\nprepared in one of its deepest abysses. There, not one of the ocean’s\r\nmonsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the _Nautilus_, of\r\nthose friends riveted to each other in death as in life. “Nor any man,\r\neither,” had added the Captain. Still the same fierce, implacable\r\ndefiance towards human society!\r\n\r\nI could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied\r\nConseil.\r\n\r\nThat worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the\r\n_Nautilus_ one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt\r\nfor indifference. For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of\r\nearth’s deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where\r\nhe might follow his instincts freely. To my mind, this explains but one\r\nside of Captain Nemo’s character. Indeed, the mystery of that last\r\nnight during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the\r\nprecaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes\r\nthe glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the\r\nman, due to an unaccountable shock of the _Nautilus_, all put me on a\r\nnew track. No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man. His\r\nformidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but\r\nperhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.\r\n\r\nAt this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light\r\namidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events\r\nshall dictate.\r\n\r\nThat day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, the second officer came\r\nto take the altitude of the sun. I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,\r\nand watched the operation. It seemed to me that the man did not\r\nunderstand French; for several times I made remarks in a loud voice,\r\nwhich must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention, if\r\nhe had understood them; but he remained undisturbed and dumb.\r\n\r\nAs he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of\r\nthe _Nautilus_ (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first\r\nsubmarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the glasses\r\nof the lantern. I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength\r\nof which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings, placed\r\nsimilar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance\r\nin a horizontal plane. The electric lamp was combined in such a way as\r\nto give its most powerful light. Indeed, it was produced in vacuo,\r\nwhich insured both its steadiness and its intensity. This vacuum\r\neconomised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was\r\ndeveloped—an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could not\r\neasily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste was\r\nimperceptible. When the _Nautilus_ was ready to continue its submarine\r\njourney, I went down to the saloon. The panel was closed, and the\r\ncourse marked direct west.\r\n\r\nWe were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain,\r\nwith a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear\r\nand transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy. The\r\n_Nautilus_ usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep. We\r\nwent on so for some days. To any one but myself, who had a great love\r\nfor the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the\r\ndaily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air\r\nof the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the\r\nsaloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up\r\nall my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.\r\n\r\nFor some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or\r\ngulls. Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made\r\nvery acceptable water-game. Amongst large-winged birds, carried a long\r\ndistance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of\r\ntheir flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant\r\ncries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of\r\nthe long-wings.\r\n\r\nAs to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised\r\nthe secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels. I saw many\r\nkinds which I never before had a chance of observing.\r\n\r\nI shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian\r\nOcean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. These\r\nfishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the\r\nCrustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor\r\nstony, but real bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, in\r\nothers of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular I saw some an inch\r\nand a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour;\r\nthey are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and I recommend\r\ntheir introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of\r\nsea-fish easily accustom themselves. I would also mention quadrangular\r\nostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over\r\nwith white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed\r\nlike birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of\r\ntheir bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called\r\n“seapigs”; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone,\r\nwhose flesh is very tough and leathery.\r\n\r\nI now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. “Certain fish of\r\nthe genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white\r\nchests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal\r\nfilaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the\r\nliveliest colours. Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides,\r\nresembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and\r\nwithout tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and\r\ncapable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling\r\nwith darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with\r\nlengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and\r\nformed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot\r\ninto the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of\r\nshell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long,\r\nand bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with\r\nrugged heads; and plenty of chaetodons, with long and tubular muzzles,\r\nwhich kill insects by shooting them, as from an air-gun, with a single\r\ndrop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas.\r\n\r\n“In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to\r\nthe second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and\r\nbronchial membranes, I remarked the scorpaena, the head of which is\r\nfurnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin; these\r\ncreatures are covered, or not, with little shells, according to the\r\nsub-class to which they belong. The second sub-class gives us specimens\r\nof didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays,\r\nand heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, it\r\ngives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately\r\ncalled a ‘seafrog,’ with large head, sometimes pierced with holes,\r\nsometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and\r\ncovered with tubercles; it has irregular and hideous horns; its body\r\nand tail are covered with callosities; its sting makes a dangerous\r\nwound; it is both repugnant and horrible to look at.”\r\n\r\nFrom the 21st to the 23rd of January the _Nautilus_ went at the rate of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred\r\nand forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour. If we recognised so many\r\ndifferent varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric\r\nlight, they tried to follow us; the greater part, however, were soon\r\ndistanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of\r\nthe _Nautilus_ for a time. The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5′ S. lat.,\r\nand 94° 33′ long., we observed Keeling Island, a coral formation,\r\nplanted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited by Mr.\r\nDarwin and Captain Fitzroy. The _Nautilus_ skirted the shores of this\r\ndesert island for a little distance. Its nets brought up numerous\r\nspecimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca. Some precious\r\nproductions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of\r\nCaptain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of\r\nparasite polypus often found fixed to a shell.\r\n\r\nSoon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was\r\ndirected to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nFrom Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often\r\ntaking us into great depths. Several times they made use of the\r\ninclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the\r\nwaterline. In that way we went about two miles, but without ever\r\nobtaining the greatest depths of the Indian Sea, which soundings of\r\nseven thousand fathoms have never reached. As to the temperature of the\r\nlower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above zero. I\r\nonly observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in\r\nthe high levels than at the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the _Nautilus_\r\npassed the day on the surface, beating the waves with its powerful\r\nscrew and making them rebound to a great height. Who under such\r\ncircumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean? Three\r\nparts of this day I spent on the platform. I watched the sea. Nothing\r\non the horizon, till about four o’clock a steamer running west on our\r\ncounter. Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see\r\nthe _Nautilus_, being too low in the water. I fancied this steamboat\r\nbelonged to the P. O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney,\r\ntouching at King George’s Point and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which\r\nbinds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by\r\na curious spectacle.\r\n\r\nIt was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the\r\nocean. We could count several hundreds. They belonged to the tubercle\r\nkind which are peculiar to the Indian seas.\r\n\r\nThese graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive\r\ntube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in. Of their\r\neight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating on the\r\nwater, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the wing\r\nlike a light sail. I saw their spiral-shaped and fluted shells, which\r\nCuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff. A boat indeed! It bears the\r\ncreature which secretes it without its adhering to it.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour the _Nautilus_ floated in the midst of this shoal of\r\nmolluscs. Then I know not what sudden fright they took. But as if at a\r\nsignal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, the\r\nshells turned over, changing their centre of gravity, and the whole\r\nfleet disappeared under the waves. Never did the ships of a squadron\r\nmanœuvre with more unity.\r\n\r\nAt that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by\r\nthe breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\nThe next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty-second\r\nmeridian and entered the northern hemisphere. During the day a\r\nformidable troop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, which\r\nmultiply in these seas and make them very dangerous. They were\r\n“cestracio philippi” sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies,\r\narmed with eleven rows of teeth—eyed sharks—their throat being marked\r\nwith a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye. There were\r\nalso some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots.\r\nThese powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the\r\nsaloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure. At such\r\ntimes Ned Land was no longer master of himself. He wanted to go to the\r\nsurface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound\r\nsharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large\r\ntiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to\r\nexcite him more particularly. But the _Nautilus_, accelerating her\r\nspeed, easily left the most rapid of them behind.\r\n\r\nThe 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met\r\nrepeatedly a forbidding spectacle, dead bodies floating on the surface\r\nof the water. They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by the\r\nGanges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only\r\nundertakers of the country, had not been able to devour. But the sharks\r\ndid not fail to help them at their funeral work.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o’clock in the evening, the _Nautilus_, half-immersed, was\r\nsailing in a sea of milk. At first sight the ocean seemed lactified.\r\nWas it the effect of the lunar rays? No; for the moon, scarcely two\r\ndays old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the\r\nsun. The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by\r\ncontrast with the whiteness of the waters.\r\n\r\nConseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the cause\r\nof this strange phenomenon. Happily I was able to answer him.\r\n\r\n“It is called a milk sea,” I explained. “A large extent of white\r\nwavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts\r\nof the sea.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” said Conseil, “can you tell me what causes such an effect?\r\nfor I suppose the water is not really turned into milk.”\r\n\r\n“No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by\r\nthe presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm,\r\ngelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose\r\nlength is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch. These insects\r\nadhere to one another sometimes for several leagues.”\r\n\r\n“Several leagues!” exclaimed Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these\r\ninfusoria. You will not be able, for, if I am not mistaken, ships have\r\nfloated on these milk seas for more than forty miles.”\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour; but behind\r\nus, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened\r\nwaves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague\r\nglimmerings of an aurora borealis."

    "title": "CHAPTER II. A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO’S",
    "text": "CHAPTER II\r\nA NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO’S\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, when at noon the _Nautilus_ came to the\r\nsurface of the sea, in 9° 4′ N. lat., there was land in sight about\r\neight miles to westward. The first thing I noticed was a range of\r\nmountains about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most\r\ncapricious. On taking the bearings, I knew that we were nearing the\r\nisland of Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo and his second appeared at this moment. The Captain\r\nglanced at the map. Then turning to me, said:\r\n\r\n“The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. Would you like to\r\nvisit one of them, M. Aronnax?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Captain.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the thing is easy. Though, if we see the fisheries, we shall not\r\nsee the fishermen. The annual exportation has not yet begun. Never\r\nmind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where we shall\r\narrive in the night.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain said something to his second, who immediately went out.\r\nSoon the _Nautilus_ returned to her native element, and the manometer\r\nshowed that she was about thirty feet deep.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Captain Nemo, “you and your companions shall visit\r\nthe Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we\r\nshall see him at work.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed, Captain!”\r\n\r\n“By the bye, M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks?”\r\n\r\n“Sharks!” exclaimed I.\r\n\r\nThis question seemed a very hard one.\r\n\r\n“Well?” continued Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“I admit, Captain, that I am not yet very familiar with that kind of\r\nfish.”\r\n\r\n“We are accustomed to them,” replied Captain Nemo, “and in time you\r\nwill be too. However, we shall be armed, and on the road we may be able\r\nto hunt some of the tribe. It is interesting. So, till to-morrow, sir,\r\nand early.”\r\n\r\nThis said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon. Now, if you\r\nwere invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what\r\nwould you say?\r\n\r\n“Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear.” If you were asked\r\nto hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian\r\njungles, what would you say?\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!” But when\r\nyou are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element, you would\r\nperhaps reflect before accepting the invitation. As for myself, I\r\npassed my hand over my forehead, on which stood large drops of cold\r\nperspiration. “Let us reflect,” said I, “and take our time. Hunting\r\notters in submarine forests, as we did in the Island of Crespo, will\r\npass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is\r\nalmost certain to meet sharks, is quite another thing! I know well that\r\nin certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the negroes\r\nnever hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a running\r\nnoose in the other; but I also know that few who affront those\r\ncreatures ever return alive. However, I am not a negro, and if I were I\r\nthink a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Conseil and the Canadian entered, quite composed, and\r\neven joyous. They knew not what awaited them.\r\n\r\n“Faith, sir,” said Ned Land, “your Captain Nemo—the devil take him!—has\r\njust made us a very pleasant offer.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said I, “you know?”\r\n\r\n“If agreeable to you, sir,” interrupted Conseil, “the commander of the\r\n_Nautilus_ has invited us to visit the magnificent Ceylon fisheries\r\nto-morrow, in your company; he did it kindly, and behaved like a real\r\ngentleman.”\r\n\r\n“He said nothing more?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more, sir, except that he had already spoken to you of this\r\nlittle walk.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Conseil, “would you give us some details of the pearl\r\nfishery?”\r\n\r\n“As to the fishing itself,” I asked, “or the incidents, which?”\r\n\r\n“On the fishing,” replied the Canadian; “before entering upon the\r\nground, it is as well to know something about it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; sit down, my friends, and I will teach you.”\r\n\r\nNed and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and the first thing\r\nthe Canadian asked was:\r\n\r\n“Sir, what is a pearl?”\r\n\r\n“My worthy Ned,” I answered, “to the poet, a pearl is a tear of the\r\nsea; to the Orientals, it is a drop of dew solidified; to the ladies,\r\nit is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl\r\nsubstance, which they wear on their fingers, their necks, or their\r\nears; for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of\r\nlime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, it is simply\r\na morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl\r\namongst certain bivalves.”\r\n\r\n“Branch of molluscs,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the\r\nearshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which\r\nsecrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white\r\nsubstance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of\r\nproducing pearls.”\r\n\r\n“Mussels too?” asked the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony,\r\nBohemia, and France.”\r\n\r\n“Good! For the future I shall pay attention,” replied the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“But,” I continued, “the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is\r\nthe pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritifera, that precious\r\npintadine. The pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in\r\na globular form, either adhering to the oyster shell, or buried in the\r\nfolds of the creature. On the shell it is fast; in the flesh it is\r\nloose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a\r\nbarren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which the pearly matter\r\ndeposits itself year after year successively, and by thin concentric\r\nlayers.”\r\n\r\n“Are many pearls found in the same oyster?” asked Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy. Some are a perfect casket. One oyster has been mentioned,\r\nthough I allow myself to doubt it, as having contained no less than a\r\nhundred and fifty sharks.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred and fifty sharks!” exclaimed Ned Land.\r\n\r\n“Did I say sharks?” said I hurriedly. “I meant to say a hundred and\r\nfifty pearls. Sharks would not be sense.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Conseil; “but will you tell us now by what means\r\nthey extract these pearls?”\r\n\r\n“They proceed in various ways. When they adhere to the shell, the\r\nfishermen often pull them off with pincers; but the most common way is\r\nto lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks. Thus\r\nthey die in the open air; and at the end of ten days they are in a\r\nforward state of decomposition. They are then plunged into large\r\nreservoirs of sea-water; then they are opened and washed.”\r\n\r\n“The price of these pearls varies according to their size?” asked\r\nConseil.\r\n\r\n“Not only according to their size,” I answered, “but also according to\r\ntheir shape, their water (that is, their colour), and their lustre:\r\nthat is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming\r\nto the eye. The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.\r\nThey are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often\r\nopaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; they are\r\ngenerally round or oval. The round are made into bracelets, the oval\r\ninto pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly. Those\r\nadhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and\r\nare sold by weight. Lastly, in a lower order are classed those small\r\npearls known under the name of seed-pearls; they are sold by measure,\r\nand are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishery dangerous?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, quickly; “particularly if certain precautions are\r\ntaken.”\r\n\r\n“What does one risk in such a calling?” said Ned Land, “the swallowing\r\nof some mouthfuls of sea-water?”\r\n\r\n“As you say, Ned. By the bye,” said I, trying to take Captain Nemo’s\r\ncareless tone, “are you afraid of sharks, brave Ned?”\r\n\r\n“I!” replied the Canadian; “a harpooner by profession? It is my trade\r\nto make light of them.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “it is not a question of fishing for them with an\r\niron-swivel, hoisting them into the vessel, cutting off their tails\r\nwith a blow of a chopper, ripping them up, and throwing their heart\r\ninto the sea!”\r\n\r\n“Then, it is a question of——”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“In the water?”\r\n\r\n“In the water.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, with a good harpoon! You know, sir, these sharks are\r\nill-fashioned beasts. They turn on their bellies to seize you, and in\r\nthat time——”\r\n\r\nNed Land had a way of saying “seize” which made my blood run cold.\r\n\r\n“Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks?”\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Conseil. “I will be frank, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” thought I.\r\n\r\n“If you, sir, mean to face the sharks, I do not see why your faithful\r\nservant should not face them with you.”"

    "text": "CHAPTER III\r\nA PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning at four o’clock I was awakened by the steward whom\r\nCaptain Nemo had placed at my service. I rose hurriedly, dressed, and\r\nwent into the saloon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was awaiting me.\r\n\r\n“M. Aronnax,” said he, “are you ready to start?”\r\n\r\n“I am ready.”\r\n\r\n“Then please to follow me.”\r\n\r\n“And my companions, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“They have been told and are waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Are we not to put on our diver’s dresses?” asked I.\r\n\r\n“Not yet. I have not allowed the _Nautilus_ to come too near this\r\ncoast, and we are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but the boat is\r\nready, and will take us to the exact point of disembarking, which will\r\nsave us a long way. It carries our diving apparatus, which we will put\r\non when we begin our submarine journey.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the\r\nplatform. Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of\r\nthe “pleasure party” which was preparing. Five sailors from the\r\n_Nautilus_, with their oars, waited in the boat, which had been made\r\nfast against the side.\r\n\r\nThe night was still dark. Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing\r\nbut few stars to be seen. I looked on the side where the land lay, and\r\nsaw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from\r\nsouth-west to north-west. The _Nautilus_, having returned during the\r\nnight up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or\r\nrather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar. There,\r\nunder the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible\r\nfield of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I took our places in the stern of\r\nthe boat. The master went to the tiller; his four companions leaned on\r\ntheir oars, the painter was cast off, and we sheered off.\r\n\r\nThe boat went towards the south; the oarsmen did not hurry. I noticed\r\nthat their strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every\r\nten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy.\r\nWhilst the craft was running by its own velocity, the liquid drops\r\nstruck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead.\r\nA little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to the boat, and\r\nsome samphire reeds flapped before it.\r\n\r\nWe were silent. What was Captain Nemo thinking of? Perhaps of the land\r\nhe was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary to the\r\nCanadian’s opinion, who thought it too far off. As to Conseil, he was\r\nmerely there from curiosity.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper\r\nline of coast more distinctly. Flat enough in the east, it rose a\r\nlittle to the south. Five miles still lay between us, and it was\r\nindistinct owing to the mist on the water. At six o’clock it became\r\nsuddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions,\r\nwhich know neither dawn nor twilight. The solar rays pierced the\r\ncurtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb\r\nrose rapidly. I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here\r\nand there. The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the\r\nsouth. Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran,\r\nfor it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the\r\nhighest points of the bank of pintadines.\r\n\r\n“Here we are, M. Aronnax,” said Captain Nemo. “You see that enclosed\r\nbay? Here, in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of\r\nthe exporters, and these are the waters their divers will ransack so\r\nboldly. Happily, this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing. It\r\nis sheltered from the strongest winds; the sea is never very rough\r\nhere, which makes it favourable for the diver’s work. We will now put\r\non our dresses, and begin our walk.”\r\n\r\nI did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with\r\nthe help of the sailors to put on my heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and\r\nmy companions were also dressing. None of the _Nautilus_ men were to\r\naccompany us on this new excursion.\r\n\r\nSoon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air\r\napparatus fixed to our backs by braces. As to the Ruhmkorff apparatus,\r\nthere was no necessity for it. Before putting my head into the copper\r\ncap, I had asked the question of the Captain.\r\n\r\n“They would be useless,” he replied. “We are going to no great depth,\r\nand the solar rays will be enough to light our walk. Besides, it would\r\nnot be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters; its\r\nbrilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast\r\nmost inopportunely.”\r\n\r\nAs Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned\r\nLand. But my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal\r\ncap, and they could neither hear nor answer.\r\n\r\nOne last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“And our arms?” asked I; “our guns?”\r\n\r\n“Guns! What for? Do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in\r\ntheir hand, and is not steel surer than lead? Here is a strong blade;\r\nput it in your belt, and we start.”\r\n\r\nI looked at my companions; they were armed like us, and, more than\r\nthat, Ned Land was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which he had placed\r\nin the boat before leaving the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\nThen, following the Captain’s example, I allowed myself to be dressed\r\nin the heavy copper helmet, and our reservoirs of air were at once in\r\nactivity. An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in\r\nabout two yards of water upon an even sand. Captain Nemo made a sign\r\nwith his hand, and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we\r\ndisappeared under the waves.\r\n\r\nOver our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, rose shoals of fish, of\r\nthe genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail. I\r\nrecognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a\r\nlivid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a\r\nconger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the\r\ngenus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, I saw some of\r\nthe most brilliant colours, carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe; an\r\nexcellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name\r\nof Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus\r\napsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight\r\nlongitudinal plates.\r\n\r\nThe heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil\r\nchanged by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of\r\nboulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the\r\nspecimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal\r\nshells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian\r\nOcean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and\r\na half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready\r\nto seize one. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and\r\nlastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the\r\nrichest vegetations of these seas.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the\r\nhydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some\r\nraninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some\r\nhorrible looking parthenopes.\r\n\r\nAt about seven o’clock we found ourselves at last surveying the\r\noyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and\r\nI could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature’s\r\ncreative power is far beyond man’s instinct of destruction. Ned Land,\r\nfaithful to his instinct, hastened to fill a net which he carried by\r\nhis side with some of the finest specimens. But we could not stop. We\r\nmust follow the Captain, who seemed to guide himself by paths known\r\nonly to himself. The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on\r\nholding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea. Then the level\r\nof the bank would sink capriciously. Often we rounded high rocks\r\nscarped into pyramids. In their dark fractures huge crustacea, perched\r\nupon their high claws like some war-machine, watched us with fixed\r\neyes, and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a\r\npicturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the\r\nsubmarine flora. At first it seemed very dark to me. The solar rays\r\nseemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague\r\ntransparency became nothing more than drowned light. Captain Nemo\r\nentered; we followed. My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this\r\nrelative state of darkness. I could distinguish the arches springing\r\ncapriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite\r\nbase, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture. Why had our\r\nincomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt? I\r\nwas soon to know. After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet\r\ntrod the bottom of a kind of circular pit. There Captain Nemo stopped,\r\nand with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived. It was\r\nan oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet\r\nwhich could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the\r\nbreadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently\r\nlarger than that ornamenting the saloon of the _Nautilus_. I approached\r\nthis extraordinary mollusc. It adhered by its filaments to a table of\r\ngranite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of\r\nthe grotto. I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lbs. Such an\r\noyster would contain 30 lbs. of meat; and one must have the stomach of\r\na Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this\r\nbivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual\r\nstate of this tridacne. The shells were a little open; the Captain came\r\nnear and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then with\r\nhis hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which formed a\r\ncloak for the creature. There, between the folded plaits, I saw a loose\r\npearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular shape,\r\nperfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a jewel of\r\ninestimable value. Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched out my\r\nhand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain stopped me,\r\nmade a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger, and the two\r\nshells closed suddenly. I then understood Captain Nemo’s intention. In\r\nleaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing\r\nit to grow slowly. Each year the secretions of the mollusc would add\r\nnew concentric circles. I estimated its value at £500,000 at least.\r\n\r\nAfter ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. I thought he had\r\nhalted previously to returning. No; by a gesture he bade us crouch\r\nbeside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part\r\nof the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.\r\n\r\nAbout five yards from me a shadow appeared, and sank to the ground. The\r\ndisquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was mistaken;\r\nand once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had anything\r\nto do with.\r\n\r\nIt was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I\r\nsuppose, had come to glean before the harvest. I could see the bottom\r\nof his canoe anchored some feet above his head. He dived and went up\r\nsuccessively. A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a\r\nsugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to\r\ndescend more rapidly. This was all his apparatus. Reaching the bottom,\r\nabout five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag with\r\noysters picked up at random. Then he went up, emptied it, pulled up his\r\nstone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty seconds.\r\n\r\nThe diver did not see us. The shadow of the rock hid us from sight. And\r\nhow should this poor Indian ever dream that men, beings like himself,\r\nshould be there under the water watching his movements and losing no\r\ndetail of the fishing? Several times he went up in this way, and dived\r\nagain. He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge, for he was\r\nobliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by means of\r\ntheir strong byssus. And how many of those oysters for which he risked\r\nhis life had no pearl in them! I watched him closely; his manœuvres\r\nwere regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger appeared to\r\nthreaten him.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting\r\nfishing, when suddenly, as the Indian was on the ground, I saw him make\r\na gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nI understood his dread. A gigantic shadow appeared just above the\r\nunfortunate diver. It was a shark of enormous size advancing\r\ndiagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open. I was mute with horror\r\nand unable to move.\r\n\r\nThe voracious creature shot towards the Indian, who threw himself on\r\none side to avoid the shark’s fins; but not its tail, for it struck his\r\nchest and stretched him on the ground.\r\n\r\nThis scene lasted but a few seconds: the shark returned, and, turning\r\non his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw\r\nCaptain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to\r\nthe monster, ready to fight face to face with him. The very moment the\r\nshark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two, he perceived his\r\nnew adversary, and, turning over, made straight towards him.\r\n\r\nI can still see Captain Nemo’s position. Holding himself well together,\r\nhe waited for the shark with admirable coolness; and, when it rushed at\r\nhim, threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness, avoiding the\r\nshock, and burying his dagger deep into its side. But it was not all\r\nover. A terrible combat ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] A terrible combat began\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shark had seemed to roar, if I might say so. The blood rushed in\r\ntorrents from its wound. The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque\r\nliquid I could distinguish nothing more. Nothing more until the moment\r\nwhen, like lightning, I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of\r\nthe creature’s fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with the\r\nmonster, and dealing successive blows at his enemy, yet still unable to\r\ngive a decisive one.\r\n\r\nThe shark’s struggles agitated the water with such fury that the\r\nrocking threatened to upset me.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go to the Captain’s assistance, but, nailed to the spot\r\nwith horror, I could not stir.\r\n\r\nI saw the haggard eye; I saw the different phases of the fight. The\r\nCaptain fell to the earth, upset by the enormous mass which leant upon\r\nhim. The shark’s jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and\r\nit would have been all over with the Captain; but, quick as thought,\r\nharpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards the shark and struck it with\r\nits sharp point.\r\n\r\nThe waves were impregnated with a mass of blood. They rocked under the\r\nshark’s movements, which beat them with indescribable fury. Ned Land\r\nhad not missed his aim. It was the monster’s death-rattle. Struck to\r\nthe heart, it struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which\r\noverthrew Conseil.\r\n\r\nBut Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any\r\nwound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held him\r\nto his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,\r\nmounted to the surface.\r\n\r\nWe all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached\r\nthe fisherman’s boat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo’s first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life\r\nagain. I did not think he could succeed. I hoped so, for the poor\r\ncreature’s immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark’s tail\r\nmight have been his death-blow.\r\n\r\nHappily, with the Captain’s and Conseil’s sharp friction, I saw\r\nconsciousness return by degrees. He opened his eyes. What was his\r\nsurprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning\r\nover him! And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,\r\ndrawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his\r\nhand! This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor\r\nCingalese was accepted with a trembling hand. His wondering eyes showed\r\nthat he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the\r\nroad already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which\r\nheld the canoe of the _Nautilus_ to the earth.\r\n\r\nOnce on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the\r\nheavy copper helmet.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo’s first word was to the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Master Land,” said he.\r\n\r\n“It was in revenge, Captain,” replied Ned Land. “I owed you that.”\r\n\r\nA ghastly smile passed across the Captain’s lips, and that was all.\r\n\r\n“To the _Nautilus_,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe boat flew over the waves. Some minutes after we met the shark’s\r\ndead body floating. By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,\r\nI recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the\r\nspecies of shark so properly called. It was more than twenty-five feet\r\nlong; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body. It was an\r\nadult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles\r\ntriangle in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious\r\nbeasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw\r\nthemselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight we were again on board the _Nautilus_. There I\r\nreflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to\r\nthe Manaar Bank.\r\n\r\nTwo conclusions I must inevitably draw from it—one bearing upon the\r\nunparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a\r\nhuman being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath\r\nthe sea. Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded\r\nin entirely crushing his heart.\r\n\r\nWhen I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n“That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am\r\nstill, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!”"

    "text": "CHAPTER IV\r\nTHE RED SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon\r\ndisappeared under the horizon, and the _Nautilus_, at a speed of twenty\r\nmiles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the\r\nMaldives from the Laccadives. It coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a\r\nland originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one\r\nof the nineteen principal islands of the Laccadive Archipelago,\r\nsituated between 10° and 14° 30′ N. lat., and 69° 50′ 72″ E. long.\r\n\r\nWe had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from our\r\nstarting-point in the Japanese Seas.\r\n\r\nThe next day (30th January), when the _Nautilus_ went to the surface of\r\nthe ocean there was no land in sight. Its course was N.N.E., in the\r\ndirection of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula,\r\nwhich serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf. It was evidently a block\r\nwithout any possible egress. Where was Captain Nemo taking us to? I\r\ncould not say. This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who that\r\nday came to me asking where we were going.\r\n\r\n“We are going where our Captain’s fancy takes us, Master Ned.”\r\n\r\n“His fancy cannot take us far, then,” said the Canadian. “The Persian\r\nGulf has no outlet: and, if we do go in, it will not be long before we\r\nare out again.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, we will come out again, Master Land; and if, after\r\nthe Persian Gulf, the _Nautilus_ would like to visit the Red Sea, the\r\nStraits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give us entrance.”\r\n\r\n“I need not tell you, sir,” said Ned Land, “that the Red Sea is as much\r\nclosed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it\r\nwas, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut\r\nwith sluices. And again, the Red Sea is not the road to take us back to\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\n“But I never said we were going back to Europe.”\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose, then?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt,\r\nthe _Nautilus_ will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the\r\nChannel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the\r\nCape of Good Hope.”\r\n\r\n“And once at the Cape of Good Hope?” asked the Canadian, with peculiar\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall penetrate into that Atlantic which we do not yet know.\r\nAh! friend Ned, you are getting tired of this journey under the sea;\r\nyou are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine\r\nwonders. For my part, I shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage which\r\nit is given to so few men to make.”\r\n\r\nFor four days, till the 3rd of February, the _Nautilus_ scoured the Sea\r\nof Oman, at various speeds and at various depths. It seemed to go at\r\nrandom, as if hesitating as to which road it should follow, but we\r\nnever passed the Tropic of Cancer.\r\n\r\nIn quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most\r\nimportant towns of the country of Oman. I admired its strange aspect,\r\nsurrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood\r\nin relief. I saw the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant points\r\nof its minarets, its fresh and verdant terraces. But it was only a\r\nvision! The _Nautilus_ soon sank under the waves of that part of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWe passed along the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut, for a\r\ndistance of six miles, its undulating line of mountains being\r\noccasionally relieved by some ancient ruin. The 5th of February we at\r\nlast entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the\r\nneck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe 6th of February, the _Nautilus_ floated in sight of Aden, perched\r\nupon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind\r\nof inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by\r\nthe English after taking possession in 1839. I caught a glimpse of the\r\noctagon minarets of this town, which was at one time the richest\r\ncommercial magazine on the coast.\r\n\r\nI certainly thought that Captain Nemo, arrived at this point, would\r\nback out again; but I was mistaken, for he did no such thing, much to\r\nmy surprise.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of\r\nBab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of\r\nTears.\r\n\r\nTo twenty miles in breadth, it is only thirty-two in length. And for\r\nthe _Nautilus_, starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the\r\nwork of an hour. But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with\r\nwhich the British Government has fortified the position of Aden. There\r\nwere too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay,\r\nCalcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing\r\nthis narrow passage, for the _Nautilus_ to venture to show itself. So\r\nit remained prudently below. At last about noon, we were in the waters\r\nof the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nI would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided\r\nCaptain Nemo upon entering the gulf. But I quite approved of the\r\n_Nautilus_ entering it. Its speed was lessened: sometimes it kept on\r\nthe surface, sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel, and thus I was able\r\nto observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea.\r\n\r\nThe 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight,\r\nnow a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which\r\nshelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important\r\ncity, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose\r\nwalls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ then approached the African shore, where the depth of\r\nthe sea was greater. There, between two waters clear as crystal,\r\nthrough the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful\r\nbushes of brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a\r\nsplendid fur of green algæ and fuci. What an indescribable spectacle,\r\nand what variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and\r\nvolcanic islands which bound the Libyan coast! But where these shrubs\r\nappeared in all their beauty was on the eastern coast, which the\r\n_Nautilus_ soon gained. It was on the coast of Tehama, for there not\r\nonly did this display of zoophytes flourish beneath the level of the\r\nsea, but they also formed picturesque interlacings which unfolded\r\nthemselves about sixty feet above the surface, more capricious but less\r\nhighly coloured than those whose freshness was kept up by the vital\r\npower of the waters.\r\n\r\nWhat charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon! What new\r\nspecimens of submarine flora and fauna did I admire under the\r\nbrightness of our electric lantern!\r\n\r\nThe 9th of February the _Nautilus_ floated in the broadest part of the\r\nRed Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and\r\nKomfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles.\r\n\r\nThat day at noon, after the bearings were taken, Captain Nemo mounted\r\nthe platform, where I happened to be, and I was determined not to let\r\nhim go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior\r\nprojects. As soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me\r\na cigar.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, does this Red Sea please you? Have you sufficiently\r\nobserved the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its\r\nparterres of sponges, and its forests of coral? Did you catch a glimpse\r\nof the towns on its borders?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Captain Nemo,” I replied; “and the _Nautilus_ is wonderfully\r\nfitted for such a study. Ah! it is an intelligent boat!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable. It fears neither the terrible\r\ntempests of the Red Sea, nor its currents, nor its sandbanks.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said I, “this sea is quoted as one of the worst, and in\r\nthe time of the ancients, if I am not mistaken, its reputation was\r\ndetestable.”\r\n\r\n“Detestable, M. Aronnax. The Greek and Latin historians do not speak\r\nfavourably of it, and Strabo says it is very dangerous during the\r\nEtesian winds and in the rainy season. The Arabian Edrisi portrays it\r\nunder the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels\r\nperished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would\r\nrisk sailing in the night. It is, he pretends, a sea subject to fearful\r\nhurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and ‘which offers nothing\r\ngood either on its surface or in its depths.’”\r\n\r\n“One may see,” I replied, “that these historians never sailed on board\r\nthe _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied the Captain, smiling; “and in that respect moderns\r\nare not more advanced than the ancients. It required many ages to find\r\nout the mechanical power of steam. Who knows if, in another hundred\r\nyears, we may not see a second _Nautilus?_ Progress is slow, M.\r\nAronnax.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” I answered; “your boat is at least a century before its\r\ntime, perhaps an era. What a misfortune that the secret of such an\r\ninvention should die with its inventor!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo did not reply. After some minutes’ silence he continued:\r\n\r\n“You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the\r\ndangerous navigation of the Red Sea.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said I; “but were not their fears exaggerated?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and no, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the\r\nRed Sea by heart. “That which is no longer dangerous for a modern\r\nvessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course,\r\nthanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of\r\nthe ancients. Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in\r\nships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated\r\nwith the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin! They\r\nhad not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they\r\nwent by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything.\r\nUnder such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous.\r\nBut in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have\r\nnothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary\r\ntrade-winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their\r\ndeparture by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return,\r\nthey no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the\r\ngods in the neighbouring temple.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” said I; “and steam seems to have killed all\r\ngratitude in the hearts of sailors. But, Captain, since you seem to\r\nhave especially studied this sea, can you tell me the origin of its\r\nname?”\r\n\r\n“There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax. Would you\r\nlike to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly.”\r\n\r\n“This fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the\r\npassage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which\r\nclosed at the voice of Moses.”\r\n\r\n“A poet’s explanation, Captain Nemo,” I replied; “but I cannot content\r\nmyself with that. I ask you for your personal opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Here it is, M. Aronnax. According to my idea, we must see in this\r\nappellation of the Red Sea a translation of the Hebrew word ‘Edom’; and\r\nif the ancients gave it that name, it was on account of the particular\r\ncolour of its waters.”\r\n\r\n“But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and\r\nwithout any particular colour.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see\r\nthis singular appearance. I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely\r\nred, like a sea of blood.”\r\n\r\n“And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic\r\nseaweed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“So, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have overrun the Red\r\nSea on board the _Nautilus?_”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“As you spoke a while ago of the passage of the Israelites and of the\r\ncatastrophe to the Egyptians, I will ask whether you have met with the\r\ntraces under the water of this great historical fact?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; and for a good reason.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is that the spot where Moses and his people passed is now so\r\nblocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there.\r\nYou can well understand that there would not be water enough for my\r\n_Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“And the spot?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The spot is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm\r\nwhich formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the\r\nSalt Lakes. Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the\r\nIsraelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and\r\nPharaoh’s army perished precisely on that spot; and I think that\r\nexcavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large\r\nnumber of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin.”\r\n\r\n“That is evident,” I replied; “and for the sake of archaeologists let\r\nus hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new\r\ntowns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the\r\nSuez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the\r\n_Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely; but useful to the whole world,” said Captain Nemo. “The\r\nancients well understood the utility of a communication between the Red\r\nSea and the Mediterranean for their commercial affairs: but they did\r\nnot think of digging a canal direct, and took the Nile as an\r\nintermediate. Very probably the canal which united the Nile to the Red\r\nSea was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition. One thing is\r\ncertain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the\r\nworks of an alimentary canal to the waters of the Nile across the plain\r\nof Egypt, looking towards Arabia. It took four days to go up this\r\ncanal, and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast. It was\r\ncarried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by\r\nPtolemy II. Strabo saw it navigated: but its decline from the point of\r\ndeparture, near Bubastes, to the Red Sea was so slight that it was only\r\nnavigable for a few months in the year. This canal answered all\r\ncommercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when it was abandoned and\r\nblocked up with sand. Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, it was\r\ndefinitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to\r\nprevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had\r\nrevolted against him. During the expedition into Egypt, your General\r\nBonaparte discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and,\r\nsurprised by the tide, he nearly perished before regaining Hadjaroth,\r\nat the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction\r\nbetween the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,\r\nM. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed\r\nAfrica into an immense island.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.\r\nSuch a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains. He\r\nbegan, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has\r\ntriumphed, for he has the genius of will. And it is sad to think that a\r\nwork like that, which ought to have been an international work and\r\nwhich would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have\r\nsucceeded by the energy of one man. All honour to M. Lesseps!”\r\n\r\n“Yes! honour to the great citizen,” I replied, surprised by the manner\r\nin which Captain Nemo had just spoken.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” he continued, “I cannot take you through the Suez\r\nCanal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after\r\nto-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean.”\r\n\r\n“The Mediterranean!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; does that astonish you?”\r\n\r\n“What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself\r\nto be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat.”\r\n\r\n“But the cause of this surprise?”\r\n\r\n“Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the _Nautilus_,\r\nif the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having\r\nmade the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!”\r\n\r\n“Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the\r\nCape of Good Hope, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Well, unless the _Nautilus_ sails on dry land, and passes above the\r\nisthmus——”\r\n\r\n“Or beneath it, M. Aronnax.”\r\n\r\n“Beneath it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Captain Nemo quietly. “A long time ago Nature made\r\nunder this tongue of land what man has this day made on its surface.”\r\n\r\n“What! such a passage exists?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel. It\r\ntakes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium.”\r\n\r\n“But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quicksands?”\r\n\r\n“To a certain depth. But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid\r\nlayer of rock.”\r\n\r\n“Did you discover this passage by chance?” I asked more and more\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n“Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.\r\nNot only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several\r\ntimes. Without that I should not have ventured this day into the\r\nimpassable Red Sea. I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the\r\nMediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind\r\nperfectly identical. Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it\r\npossible that there was no communication between the two seas? If there\r\nwas, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red Sea to\r\nthe Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level. I caught\r\na large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez. I passed a\r\ncopper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the sea. Some\r\nmonths later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my fish\r\nornamented with the ring. Thus the communication between the two was\r\nproved. I then sought for it with my _Nautilus;_ I discovered it,\r\nventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed\r\nthrough my Arabian tunnel!”"

    "text": "CHAPTER V\r\nTHE ARABIAN TUNNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening, in 21° 30′ N. lat., the _Nautilus_ floated on the\r\nsurface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast. I saw Djeddah, the\r\nmost important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India. I\r\ndistinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the\r\nquays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the\r\nroads. The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses of\r\nthe town, bringing out their whiteness. Outside, some wooden cabins,\r\nand some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the Bedouins.\r\nSoon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night, and the\r\n_Nautilus_ found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to\r\nwindward. The _Nautilus_ returned to its submarine navigation; but at\r\nnoon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose\r\nagain to her waterline.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform. The\r\ncoast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a\r\ndamp fog.\r\n\r\nWe were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and\r\nanother, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the\r\nsea, said:\r\n\r\n“Do you see anything there, sir?”\r\n\r\n“No, Ned,” I replied; “but I have not your eyes, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Look well,” said Ned, “there, on the starboard beam, about the height\r\nof the lantern! Do you not see a mass which seems to move?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said I, after close attention; “I see something like a\r\nlong black body on the top of the water.”\r\n\r\nAnd certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile\r\nfrom us. It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea. It\r\nwas a gigantic dugong!\r\n\r\nNed Land looked eagerly. His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight\r\nof the animal. His hand seemed ready to harpoon it. One would have\r\nthought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and\r\nattack it in its element.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform. He saw the\r\ndugong, understood the Canadian’s attitude, and, addressing him, said:\r\n\r\n“If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your\r\nhand?”\r\n\r\n“Just so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a\r\nfisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have\r\nalready killed?”\r\n\r\n“I should not, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can try.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.\r\n\r\n“Only,” continued the Captain, “I advise you for your own sake not to\r\nmiss the creature.”\r\n\r\n“Is the dugong dangerous to attack?” I asked, in spite of the\r\nCanadian’s shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Captain; “sometimes the animal turns upon its\r\nassailants and overturns their boat. But for Master Land this danger is\r\nnot to be feared. His eye is prompt, his arm sure.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,\r\nmounted the platform. One carried a harpoon and a line similar to those\r\nemployed in catching whales. The pinnace was lifted from the bridge,\r\npulled from its socket, and let down into the sea. Six oarsmen took\r\ntheir seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I\r\nwent to the back of the boat.\r\n\r\n“You are not coming, Captain?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; but I wish you good sport.”\r\n\r\nThe boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards\r\nthe dugong, which floated about two miles from the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\nArrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and\r\nthe oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters. Ned Land, harpoon in\r\nhand, stood in the fore part of the boat. The harpoon used for striking\r\nthe whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs out\r\nrapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him. But here the cord\r\nwas not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached to a\r\nsmall barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong took\r\nunder the water.\r\n\r\nI stood and carefully watched the Canadian’s adversary. This dugong,\r\nwhich also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the\r\nmanatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its\r\nlateral fins in perfect fingers. Its difference from the manatee\r\nconsisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed\r\nteeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.\r\n\r\nThis dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal\r\ndimensions; it was more than seven yards long. It did not move, and\r\nseemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier\r\nto capture.\r\n\r\nThe boat approached within six yards of the animal. The oars rested on\r\nthe rowlocks. I half rose. Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,\r\nbrandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared. The\r\nharpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n“Curse it!” exclaimed the Canadian furiously; “I have missed it!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said I; “the creature is wounded—look at the blood; but your\r\nweapon has not stuck in his body.”\r\n\r\n“My harpoon! my harpoon!” cried Ned Land.\r\n\r\nThe sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.\r\nThe harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe latter came now and then to the surface to breathe. Its wound had\r\nnot weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track. Several times it\r\napproached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,\r\nbut the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to\r\nreach it.\r\n\r\nImagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land! He hurled at the\r\nunfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English\r\ntongue. For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nWe pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it\r\nwould prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the\r\nperverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon\r\nthe pinnace and assailed us in its turn.\r\n\r\nThis manœuvre did not escape the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Look out!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThe coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless\r\nwarning the men to keep on their guard.\r\n\r\nThe dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the\r\nair briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but\r\nin the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw\r\nhimself upon us.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least\r\ntwo tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the\r\ncoxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite\r\noverturned. While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the\r\ngigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature’s teeth were\r\nburied in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,\r\nas a lion does a roebuck. We were upset over one another, and I know\r\nnot how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged\r\nwith the beast, had not struck it to the heart.\r\n\r\nI heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,\r\ncarrying the harpoon with him. But the barrel soon returned to the\r\nsurface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.\r\nThe boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the\r\n_Nautilus_.\r\n\r\nIt required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the\r\nplatform. It weighed 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe next day, 11th February, the larder of the _Nautilus_ was enriched\r\nby some more delicate game. A flight of sea-swallows rested on the\r\n_Nautilus_. It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;\r\nits beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white\r\nspots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and\r\nthroat white, and claws red. They also took some dozen of Nile ducks, a\r\nwild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head white\r\nwith black spots.\r\n\r\nAbout five o’clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of\r\nRas-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,\r\ncomprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the\r\nGulf of Suez. I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the\r\ntwo gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of\r\nwhich Moses saw God face to face.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock the _Nautilus_, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,\r\npassed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the\r\nwaters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by\r\nCaptain Nemo. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,\r\nsometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and\r\nthe noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the\r\nrocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the\r\nGulf with its noisy paddles.\r\n\r\nFrom eight to nine o’clock the _Nautilus_ remained some fathoms under\r\nthe water. According to my calculation we must have been very near\r\nSuez. Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks\r\nbrilliantly lit up by our electric lamp. We seemed to be leaving the\r\nStraits behind us more and more.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I\r\nmounted the platform. Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo’s\r\ntunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh\r\nnight air.\r\n\r\nSoon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,\r\nshining about a mile from us.\r\n\r\n“A floating lighthouse!” said someone near me.\r\n\r\nI turned, and saw the Captain.\r\n\r\n“It is the floating light of Suez,” he continued. “It will not be long\r\nbefore we gain the entrance of the tunnel.”\r\n\r\n“The entrance cannot be easy?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman’s\r\ncage and myself direct our course. And now, if you will go down, M.\r\nAronnax, the _Nautilus_ is going under the waves, and will not return\r\nto the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he\r\nopened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot’s\r\ncage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.\r\nIt was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied\r\nby the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson. In the\r\nmidst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,\r\nwhich ran to the back of the _Nautilus_. Four light-ports with\r\nlenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,\r\nallowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.\r\n\r\nThis cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the\r\nobscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands\r\nresting on the spokes of the wheel. Outside, the sea appeared vividly\r\nlit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin\r\nto the other extremity of the platform.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Captain Nemo, “let us try to make our passage.”\r\n\r\nElectric wires connected the pilot’s cage with the machinery room, and\r\nfrom there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his\r\n_Nautilus_ the direction and the speed. He pressed a metal knob, and at\r\nonce the speed of the screw diminished.\r\n\r\nI looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at\r\nthis moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast. We followed\r\nit thus for an hour only some few yards off.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two\r\nconcentric circles in the cabin. At a simple gesture, the pilot\r\nmodified the course of the _Nautilus_ every instant.\r\n\r\nI had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent\r\nsubstructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their\r\nenormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm. A large\r\ngallery, black and deep, opened before us. The _Nautilus_ went boldly\r\ninto it. A strange roaring was heard round its sides. It was the waters\r\nof the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated violently\r\ntowards the Mediterranean. The _Nautilus_ went with the torrent, rapid\r\nas an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery, which, in order\r\nto offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with reversed screw.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant\r\nrays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under\r\nthe brilliant electric light. My heart beat fast.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,\r\nturning to me, said:\r\n\r\n“The Mediterranean!”\r\n\r\nIn less than twenty minutes, the _Nautilus_, carried along by the\r\ntorrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez."

    "text": "CHAPTER VI\r\nTHE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the _Nautilus_\r\nrose to the surface. I hastened on to the platform. Three miles to the\r\nsouth the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen. A torrent had carried\r\nus from one sea to another. About seven o’clock Ned and Conseil joined\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sir Naturalist,” said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,\r\n“and the Mediterranean?”\r\n\r\n“We are floating on its surface, friend Ned.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Conseil, “this very night.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable\r\nisthmus.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe it,” replied the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Then you are wrong, Master Land,” I continued; “this low coast which\r\nrounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast. And you who have such\r\ngood eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian looked attentively.\r\n\r\n“Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man. We\r\nare in the Mediterranean. Good! Now, if you please, let us talk of our\r\nown little affair, but so that no one hears us.”\r\n\r\nI saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better\r\nto let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down\r\nnear the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the\r\nblades.\r\n\r\n“Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?”\r\n\r\n“What I have to tell you is very simple. We are in Europe; and before\r\nCaptain Nemo’s caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar\r\nSeas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\nI wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I\r\ncertainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nThanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the\r\ncompletion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of\r\nsubmarine depths in its very element. Should I ever again have such an\r\nopportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean? No, certainly not!\r\nAnd I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the _Nautilus_\r\nbefore the cycle of investigation was accomplished.\r\n\r\n“Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board? Are\r\nyou sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo’s hands?”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian remained some moments without answering. Then, crossing\r\nhis arms, he said:\r\n\r\n“Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas. I shall be glad\r\nto have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.\r\nThat is my idea.”\r\n\r\n“It will come to an end, Ned.”\r\n\r\n“Where and when?”\r\n\r\n“Where I do not know—when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will\r\nend when these seas have nothing more to teach us.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do you hope for?” demanded the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which\r\nwe may and ought to profit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Ned Land, “and where shall we be in six months, if you\r\nplease, Sir Naturalist?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps in China; you know the _Nautilus_ is a rapid traveller. It\r\ngoes through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the\r\nland. It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not\r\nbeat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be\r\nattempted as advantageously as here.”\r\n\r\n“M. Aronnax,” replied the Canadian, “your arguments are rotten at the\r\nfoundation. You speak in the future, ‘We shall be there! we shall be\r\nhere!’ I speak in the present, ‘We are here, and we must profit by\r\nit.’”\r\n\r\nNed Land’s logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that\r\nground. I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” continued Ned, “let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo\r\nshould this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“And if,” he added, “the offer made you this day was never to be\r\nrenewed, would you accept it?”\r\n\r\n“Friend Ned, this is my answer. Your reasoning is against me. We must\r\nnot rely on Captain Nemo’s good-will. Common prudence forbids him to\r\nset us at liberty. On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the\r\nfirst opportunity to leave the _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said.”\r\n\r\n“Only one observation—just one. The occasion must be serious, and our\r\nfirst attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,\r\nand Captain Nemo will never forgive us.”\r\n\r\n“All that is true,” replied the Canadian. “But your observation applies\r\nequally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years’ time, or in\r\ntwo days’. But the question is still this: If a favourable opportunity\r\npresents itself, it must be seized.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed! And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable\r\nopportunity?”\r\n\r\n“It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the _Nautilus_ a\r\nshort distance from some European coast.”\r\n\r\n“And you will try and save yourself by swimming?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was\r\nfloating at the time. Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was\r\nunder the water.”\r\n\r\n“And in that case?”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace. I\r\nknow how it is worked. We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn, we\r\nshall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who is\r\nin the bows, perceiving our flight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch\r\nwill ruin us.”\r\n\r\n“I will not forget, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, M. Aronnax.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I think—I do not say I hope—I think that this favourable\r\nopportunity will never present itself.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given\r\nup all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,\r\nabove all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.\r\n\r\n“And now, Ned Land,” I added, “let us stop here. Not another word on\r\nthe subject. The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we\r\nwill follow you. I rely entirely upon you.”\r\n\r\nThus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such\r\ngrave results. I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my\r\nforesight, to the Canadian’s great despair. Did Captain Nemo distrust\r\nus in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from\r\nthe numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?\r\nI could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the\r\ncoast. Or, if the _Nautilus_ did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the\r\npilot’s cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the\r\nGrecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by\r\nmore than a thousand fathoms.\r\n\r\nThus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the\r\nSporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:\r\n\r\n“Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,\r\nCaeruleus Proteus,”\r\n\r\n\r\nas he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of\r\nNeptune’s flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes\r\nand Crete. I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels\r\nof the saloon.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in\r\nstudying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other\r\nthe panels remained hermetically sealed. Upon taking the course of the\r\n_Nautilus_, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle\r\nof Crete. At the time I embarked on the _Abraham Lincoln_, the whole of\r\nthis island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the\r\nTurks. But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was\r\nabsolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land\r\ncommunications, who could tell me.\r\n\r\nI made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone\r\nwith him in the saloon. Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and\r\npreoccupied. Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to be\r\nopened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of waters\r\nattentively. To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I employed\r\nmy time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his\r\nbelt a leathern purse. It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it was\r\na living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing occasionally to\r\ntake breath at the surface.\r\n\r\nI turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“A man shipwrecked! He must be saved at any price!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] “A man! A shipwrecked sailor!” I cried\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.\r\n\r\nThe man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,\r\nwas looking at us.\r\n\r\nTo my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him. The diver answered\r\nwith his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did\r\nnot appear again.\r\n\r\n“Do not be uncomfortable,” said Captain Nemo. “It is Nicholas of Cape\r\nMatapan, surnamed Pesca. He is well known in all the Cyclades. A bold\r\ndiver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,\r\ngoing continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete.”\r\n\r\n“You know him, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“Why not, M. Aronnax?”\r\n\r\nSaying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing\r\nnear the left panel of the saloon. Near this piece of furniture, I saw\r\na chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,\r\nbearing the cypher of the _Nautilus_ with its device.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the\r\npiece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many\r\ningots.\r\n\r\nThey were ingots of gold. From whence came this precious metal, which\r\nrepresented an enormous sum? Where did the Captain gather this gold\r\nfrom? and what was he going to do with it?\r\n\r\nI did not say one word. I looked. Captain Nemo took the ingots one by\r\none, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled\r\nentirely. I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lbs. weight of\r\ngold, that is to say, nearly £200,000.\r\n\r\nThe chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on\r\nthe lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.\r\n\r\nThis done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated\r\nwith the quarters of the crew. Four men appeared, and, not without some\r\ntrouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon. Then I heard them hoisting\r\nit up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.\r\n\r\n“And you were saying, sir?” said he.\r\n\r\n“I was saying nothing, Captain.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he turned and left the saloon.\r\n\r\nI returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe. I vainly tried\r\nto sleep—I sought the connecting link between the apparition of the\r\ndiver and the chest filled with gold. Soon, I felt by certain movements\r\nof pitching and tossing that the _Nautilus_ was leaving the depths and\r\nreturning to the surface.\r\n\r\nThen I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening\r\nthe pinnace and launching it upon the waves. For one instant it struck\r\nthe side of the _Nautilus_, then all noise ceased.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;\r\nthe boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the\r\n_Nautilus_ again plunged under the waves.\r\n\r\nSo these millions had been transported to their address. To what point\r\nof the continent? Who was Captain Nemo’s correspondent?\r\n\r\nThe next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the\r\nnight, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree. My\r\ncompanions were not less surprised than myself.\r\n\r\n“But where does he take his millions to?” asked Ned Land.\r\n\r\nTo that there was no possible answer. I returned to the saloon after\r\nhaving breakfast and set to work. Till five o’clock in the evening I\r\nemployed myself in arranging my notes. At that moment—(ought I to\r\nattribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)—I felt so great a heat that\r\nI was obliged to take off my coat. It was strange, for we were under\r\nlow latitudes; and even then the _Nautilus_, submerged as it was, ought\r\nto experience no change of temperature. I looked at the manometer; it\r\nshowed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat could never\r\nattain.\r\n\r\nI continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n“Could there be fire on board?” I asked myself.\r\n\r\nI was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the\r\nthermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:\r\n\r\n“Forty-two degrees.”\r\n\r\n“I have noticed it, Captain,” I replied; “and if it gets much hotter we\r\ncannot bear it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, it will not get hotter if we do not wish it.”\r\n\r\n“You can reduce it as you please, then?”\r\n\r\n“No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it.”\r\n\r\n“It is outward, then!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Look.”\r\n\r\nThe panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round. A\r\nsulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in\r\na copper. I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat\r\nwas so great that I quickly took it off again.\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Near the Island of Santorin, sir,” replied the Captain. “I wished to\r\ngive you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said I, “that the formation of these new islands was\r\nended.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea,” replied\r\nCaptain Nemo; “and the globe is always being worked by subterranean\r\nfires. Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to\r\nCassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in\r\nthe very place where these islets have recently been formed. Then they\r\nsank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again\r\nsubsided. Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been\r\nsuspended. But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they\r\nnamed George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour\r\nnear Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month. Seven\r\ndays after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,\r\nleaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad. I was\r\nin these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to\r\nobserve all the different phases. The Island of Aphroessa, of round\r\nform, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height. It was\r\ncomposed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.\r\nAnd lately, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed\r\nitself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined\r\ntogether, forming but one and the same island.”\r\n\r\n“And the canal in which we are at this moment?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Here it is,” replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the\r\nArchipelago. “You see, I have marked the new islands.”\r\n\r\nI returned to the glass. The _Nautilus_ was no longer moving, the heat\r\nwas becoming unbearable. The sea, which till now had been white, was\r\nred, owing to the presence of salts of iron. In spite of the ship’s\r\nbeing hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the\r\nsaloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished\r\nby bright scarlet flames. I was in a bath, I was choking, I was\r\nbroiled.\r\n\r\n“We can remain no longer in this boiling water,” said I to the Captain.\r\n\r\n“It would not be prudent,” replied the impassive Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nAn order was given; the _Nautilus_ tacked about and left the furnace it\r\ncould not brave with impunity. A quarter of an hour after we were\r\nbreathing fresh air on the surface. The thought then struck me that, if\r\nNed Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should\r\nnever have come alive out of this sea of fire.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between\r\nRhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and\r\nthe _Nautilus_, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian\r\nArchipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan."

    "title": "CHAPTER VII. THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS",
    "text": "CHAPTER VII\r\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, “the great sea” of the\r\nHebrews, “the sea” of the Greeks, the “mare nostrum” of the Romans,\r\nbordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with\r\nthe perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with\r\npure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;\r\na perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the\r\nempire of the world!\r\n\r\nIt is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is\r\nrenewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe. But,\r\nbeautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin\r\nwhose superficial area is two million of square yards. Even Captain\r\nNemo’s knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not\r\nappear once during our passage at full speed. I estimated the course\r\nwhich the _Nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six\r\nhundred leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours. Starting\r\non the morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we\r\nhad crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of\r\nthose countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain\r\nNemo. Those waves and those breezes brought back too many remembrances,\r\nif not too many regrets. Here he had no longer that independence and\r\nthat liberty of gait which he had when in the open seas, and his\r\n_Nautilus_ felt itself cramped between the close shores of Africa and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOur speed was now twenty-five miles an hour. It may be well understood\r\nthat Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his\r\nintended flight. He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of\r\ntwelve or thirteen yards every second. To quit the _Nautilus_ under\r\nsuch conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full\r\nspeed—an imprudent thing, to say the least of it. Besides, our vessel\r\nonly mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of\r\nair; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.\r\n\r\nI saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by\r\nexpress train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;\r\nthat is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which\r\npass like a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nWe were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis. In the\r\nnarrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of\r\nthe sea rose almost suddenly. There was a perfect bank, on which there\r\nwas not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the\r\ndepth was ninety fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ had to manœuvre very carefully so as not to strike\r\nagainst this submarine barrier.\r\n\r\nI showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by\r\nthis reef.\r\n\r\n“But if you please, sir,” observed Conseil, “it is like a real isthmus\r\njoining Europe to Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the\r\nsoundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents\r\nbetween Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined.”\r\n\r\n“I can well believe it,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“I will add,” I continued, “that a similar barrier exists between\r\nGibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire\r\nMediterranean.”\r\n\r\n“What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers\r\nabove the waves?”\r\n\r\n“It is not probable, Conseil.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should\r\ntake place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so\r\nmuch pains to pierce the isthmus.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never\r\nhappen. The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.\r\nVolcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being\r\nextinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature\r\nof the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity\r\nevery century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life.”\r\n\r\n“But the sun?”\r\n\r\n“The sun is not sufficient, Conseil. Can it give heat to a dead body?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will\r\nbecome uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long\r\nsince lost all its vital heat.”\r\n\r\n“In how many centuries?”\r\n\r\n“In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Conseil, “we shall have time to finish our journey—that\r\nis, if Ned Land does not interfere with it.”\r\n\r\nAnd Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the\r\n_Nautilus_ was skirting at a moderate speed.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the\r\nsecond Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450\r\nfathoms. The _Nautilus_, by the action of its screw, slid down the\r\ninclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February, about three o’clock in the morning, we were at\r\nthe entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar. There once existed two\r\ncurrents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters\r\nof the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower\r\ncounter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist. Indeed, the\r\nvolume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves\r\nof the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise\r\nthe level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore\r\nthe equilibrium. As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the\r\nexistence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the\r\nAtlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the\r\nMediterranean. A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which\r\nthe _Nautilus_ profited. It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass. For\r\none instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of\r\nHercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low\r\nisland which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on\r\nthe Atlantic."

    "title": "CHAPTER VIII. VIGO BAY",
    "text": "CHAPTER VIII\r\nVIGO BAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers\r\ntwenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine\r\nthousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred—an\r\nocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,\r\nwatered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the\r\nMississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the\r\nSenegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the\r\nmost civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries! Magnificent\r\nfield of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every nation,\r\nsheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in those\r\ntwo terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the Cape of\r\nTempests.\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having\r\naccomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a\r\ndistance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we\r\ngoing now, and what was reserved for the future? The _Nautilus_,\r\nleaving the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out. It returned to the\r\nsurface of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nI mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil. At a distance\r\nof about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming\r\nthe south-western point of the Spanish peninsula. A strong southerly\r\ngale was blowing. The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the\r\n_Nautilus_ rock violently. It was almost impossible to keep one’s foot\r\non the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every\r\ninstant. So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.\r\n\r\nI returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a\r\npreoccupied air, followed me. Our rapid passage across the\r\nMediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,\r\nand he could not help showing his disappointment. When the door of my\r\nroom was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.\r\n\r\n“Friend Ned,” said I, “I understand you; but you cannot reproach\r\nyourself. To have attempted to leave the _Nautilus_ under the\r\ncircumstances would have been folly.”\r\n\r\nNed Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed\r\nwith him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” I continued; “we need not despair yet. We are going up\r\nthe coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where\r\nwe can easily find refuge. Now if the _Nautilus_, on leaving the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us\r\ntowards regions where there were no continents, I should share your\r\nuneasiness. But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from\r\ncivilised seas, and in some days I think you can act with security.”\r\n\r\nNed Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,\r\nand he said, “It is for to-night.”\r\n\r\nI drew myself up suddenly. I was, I admit, little prepared for this\r\ncommunication. I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“We agreed to wait for an opportunity,” continued Ned Land, “and the\r\nopportunity has arrived. This night we shall be but a few miles from\r\nthe Spanish coast. It is cloudy. The wind blows freely. I have your\r\nword, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you.”\r\n\r\nAs I was silent, the Canadian approached me.\r\n\r\n“To-night, at nine o’clock,” said he. “I have warned Conseil. At that\r\nmoment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.\r\nNeither the engineers nor the ship’s crew can see us. Conseil and I\r\nwill gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in\r\nthe library, two steps from us, waiting my signal. The oars, the mast,\r\nand the sail are in the canoe. I have even succeeded in getting some\r\nprovisions. I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts\r\nwhich attach it to the shell of the _Nautilus_. So all is ready, till\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“The sea is bad.”\r\n\r\n“That I allow,” replied the Canadian; “but we must risk that. Liberty\r\nis worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with\r\na fair wind to carry us is no great thing. Who knows but by to-morrow\r\nwe may be a hundred leagues away? Let circumstances only favour us, and\r\nby ten or eleven o’clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra\r\nfirma, alive or dead. But adieu now till to-night.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb. I had\r\nimagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and\r\ndiscuss the matter. My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,\r\nafter all, what could I have said to him? Ned Land was perfectly right.\r\nThere was almost the opportunity to profit by. Could I retract my word,\r\nand take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of\r\nmy companions? To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs\r\nwere filling, and that the _Nautilus_ was sinking under the waves of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nA sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of\r\naction and of abandoning the wonderful _Nautilus_, and leaving my\r\nsubmarine studies incomplete.\r\n\r\nWhat dreadful hours I passed thus! Sometimes seeing myself and\r\ncompanions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,\r\nthat some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned\r\nLand’s project.\r\n\r\nTwice I went to the saloon. I wished to consult the compass. I wished\r\nto see if the direction the _Nautilus_ was taking was bringing us\r\nnearer or taking us farther from the coast. But no; the _Nautilus_ kept\r\nin Portuguese waters.\r\n\r\nI must therefore take my part and prepare for flight. My luggage was\r\nnot heavy; my notes, nothing more.\r\n\r\nAs to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;\r\nwhat trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in\r\ncase of its discovery or failure. Certainly I had no cause to complain\r\nof him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his. In\r\nleaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude. No oath bound us to\r\nhim. It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon\r\nour word, to fix us for ever.\r\n\r\nI had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.\r\nWould chance bring me to his presence before our departure? I wished\r\nit, and I feared it at the same time. I listened if I could hear him\r\nwalking the room contiguous to mine. No sound reached my ear. I felt an\r\nunbearable uneasiness. This day of waiting seemed eternal. Hours struck\r\ntoo slowly to keep pace with my impatience.\r\n\r\nMy dinner was served in my room as usual. I ate but little; I was too\r\npreoccupied. I left the table at seven o’clock. A hundred and twenty\r\nminutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I\r\nwas to join Ned Land. My agitation redoubled. My pulse beat violently.\r\nI could not remain quiet. I went and came, hoping to calm my troubled\r\nspirit by constant movement. The idea of failure in our bold enterprise\r\nwas the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought of seeing our\r\nproject discovered before leaving the _Nautilus_, of being brought\r\nbefore Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened, at my\r\ndesertion, made my heart beat.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see the saloon for the last time. I descended the stairs\r\nand arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and\r\nagreeable hours. I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a\r\nman on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.\r\n\r\nThese wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for\r\nso many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them\r\nfor ever! I should like to have taken a last look through the windows\r\nof the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic: but the panels were\r\nhermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean\r\nwhich I had not yet explored.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle\r\nwhich opened into the Captain’s room. To my great surprise, this door\r\nwas ajar. I drew back involuntarily. If Captain Nemo should be in his\r\nroom, he could see me. But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer. The room\r\nwas deserted. I pushed open the door and took some steps forward. Still\r\nthe same monklike severity of aspect.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the clock struck eight. The first beat of the hammer on the\r\nbell awoke me from my dreams. I trembled as if an invisible eye had\r\nplunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nThere my eye fell upon the compass. Our course was still north. The log\r\nindicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.\r\n\r\nI returned to my room, clothed myself warmly—sea boots, an otterskin\r\ncap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was\r\nwaiting. The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which\r\nreigned on board. I listened attentively. Would no loud voice suddenly\r\ninform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected flight. A\r\nmortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my accustomed\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain’s door. No noise.\r\nI left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in obscurity,\r\nbut deserted.\r\n\r\nI opened the door communicating with the library. The same insufficient\r\nlight, the same solitude. I placed myself near the door leading to the\r\ncentral staircase, and there waited for Ned Land’s signal.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it\r\nstopped entirely. The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings of\r\nmy own heart. Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the\r\n_Nautilus_ had stopped at the bottom of the ocean. My uneasiness\r\nincreased. The Canadian’s signal did not come. I felt inclined to join\r\nNed Land and beg of him to put off his attempt. I felt that we were not\r\nsailing under our usual conditions.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo\r\nappeared. He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable\r\ntone of voice:\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir! I have been looking for you. Do you know the history of\r\nSpain?”\r\n\r\nNow, one might know the history of one’s own country by heart; but in\r\nthe condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite\r\nlost, I could not have said a word of it.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Captain Nemo, “you heard my question! Do you know the\r\nhistory of Spain?”\r\n\r\n“Very slightly,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, here are learned men having to learn,” said the Captain. “Come,\r\nsit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history. Sir,\r\nlisten well,” said he; “this history will interest you on one side, for\r\nit will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to\r\nsolve.”\r\n\r\n“I listen, Captain,” said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was\r\ndriving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our\r\nprojected flight.\r\n\r\n“Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702. You cannot be\r\nignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a\r\npotentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had\r\nimposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards. This prince\r\nreigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong\r\nparty against him abroad. Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses\r\nof Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at\r\nthe Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the\r\nhead of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they\r\nprematurely gave the title of Charles III.\r\n\r\n“Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely\r\nunprovided with either soldiers or sailors. However, money would not\r\nfail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver\r\nfrom America, once entered their ports. And about the end of 1702 they\r\nexpected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of\r\ntwenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the\r\nships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic. This convoy\r\nwas to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was\r\ncruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.\r\n\r\n“The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision. They\r\nwanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo\r\nBay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not\r\nblocked.\r\n\r\n“Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and\r\nthe galleons entered Vigo Bay.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in\r\nany way. They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the\r\narrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had\r\nnot a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.\r\n\r\n“You are following the chain of events?” asked Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n“I will continue. This is what passed. The merchants of Cadiz had a\r\nprivilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise\r\ncoming from the West Indies. Now, to disembark these ingots at the port\r\nof Vigo was depriving them of their rights. They complained at Madrid,\r\nand obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the convoy,\r\nwithout discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the roads\r\nof Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the\r\nEnglish vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in\r\nspite of inferior forces, fought bravely. But, seeing that the treasure\r\nmust fall into the enemy’s hands, he burnt and scuttled every galleon,\r\nwhich went to the bottom with their immense riches.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo stopped. I admit I could not see yet why this history\r\nshould interest me.\r\n\r\n“Well?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, “we are in that Vigo Bay; and\r\nit rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain rose, telling me to follow him. I had had time to recover.\r\nI obeyed. The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the\r\nwaves were sparkling. I looked.\r\n\r\nFor half a mile around the _Nautilus_, the waters seemed bathed in\r\nelectric light. The sandy bottom was clean and bright. Some of the\r\nship’s crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten\r\nbarrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks. From\r\nthese cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,\r\ncascades of piastres and jewels. The sand was heaped up with them.\r\nLaden with their precious booty, the men returned to the _Nautilus_,\r\ndisposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery\r\nof gold and silver.\r\n\r\nI understood now. This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of\r\nOctober, 1702. Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the\r\nSpanish Government had sunk. Here Captain Nemo came, according to his\r\nwants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the _Nautilus_.\r\nIt was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.\r\nHe was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn\r\nfrom the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.\r\n\r\n“Did you know, sir,” he asked, smiling, “that the sea contained such\r\nriches?”\r\n\r\n“I knew,” I answered, “that they value money held in suspension in\r\nthese waters at two millions.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than\r\nthe profit. Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has\r\nlost—and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where\r\nshipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map. Can\r\nyou understand now the source of the millions I am worth?”\r\n\r\n“I understand, Captain. But allow me to tell you that in exploring Vigo\r\nBay you have only been beforehand with a rival society.”\r\n\r\n“And which?”\r\n\r\n“A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege\r\nof seeking those buried galleons. The shareholders are led on by the\r\nallurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks\r\nat five hundred millions.”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred millions they were,” answered Captain Nemo, “but they are\r\nso no longer.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said I; “and a warning to those shareholders would be an act\r\nof charity. But who knows if it would be well received? What gamblers\r\nusually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their\r\nfoolish hopes. After all, I pity them less than the thousands of\r\nunfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been\r\nprofitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren.”\r\n\r\nI had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have\r\nwounded Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“Barren!” he exclaimed, with animation. “Do you think then, sir, that\r\nthese riches are lost because I gather them? Is it for myself alone,\r\naccording to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these\r\ntreasures? Who told you that I did not make a good use of it? Do you\r\nthink I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races\r\non this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge? Do\r\nyou not understand?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he\r\nhad spoken so much. But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which\r\nhad forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him\r\nstill a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,\r\nand that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as\r\nindividuals. And I then understood for whom those millions were\r\ndestined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the _Nautilus_ was\r\ncruising in the waters of Crete."

    "text": "CHAPTER IX\r\nA VANISHED CONTINENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my\r\nroom. I expected this visit. He looked very disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended\r\nleaving his vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers.”\r\n\r\n“His bankers!”\r\n\r\n“Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his\r\nriches are safer than in the chests of the State.”\r\n\r\nI then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,\r\nhoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but\r\nmy recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret\r\nfrom Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of\r\nVigo on his own account.\r\n\r\n“However,” said he, “all is not ended. It is only a blow of the harpoon\r\nlost. Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if necessary——”\r\n\r\n“In what direction is the _Nautilus_ going?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” replied Ned.\r\n\r\n“Well, at noon we shall see the point.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian returned to Conseil. As soon as I was dressed, I went into\r\nthe saloon. The compass was not reassuring. The course of the\r\n_Nautilus_ was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.\r\n\r\nI waited with some impatience till the ship’s place was pricked on the\r\nchart. At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our\r\nvessel rose to the surface of the ocean. I rushed towards the platform.\r\nNed Land had preceded me. No more land in sight. Nothing but an immense\r\nsea. Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going to San Roque in\r\nsearch of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The\r\nweather was cloudy. A gale of wind was preparing. Ned raved, and tried\r\nto pierce the cloudy horizon. He still hoped that behind all that fog\r\nstretched the land he so longed for.\r\n\r\nAt noon the sun showed itself for an instant. The second profited by\r\nthis brightness to take its height. Then, the sea becoming more\r\nbillowy, we descended, and the panel closed.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the\r\n_Nautilus_ was marked at 16° 17′ long., and 33° 22′ lat., at 150\r\nleagues from the nearest coast. There was no means of flight, and I\r\nleave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of\r\nour situation.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I was not particularly sorry. I felt lightened of the load\r\nwhich had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of\r\ncalmness to my accustomed work.\r\n\r\nThat night, about eleven o’clock, I received a most unexpected visit\r\nfrom Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from\r\nmy watch of the preceding night. I answered in the negative.\r\n\r\n“Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion.”\r\n\r\n“Propose, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under\r\nthe brightness of the sun. Would it suit you to see them in the\r\ndarkness of the night?”\r\n\r\n“Most willingly.”\r\n\r\n“I warn you, the way will be tiring. We shall have far to walk, and\r\nmust climb a mountain. The roads are not well kept.”\r\n\r\n“What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to\r\nfollow you.”\r\n\r\n“Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses.”\r\n\r\nArrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any\r\nof the ship’s crew were to follow us on this excursion. Captain Nemo\r\nhad not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our\r\nbacks the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps\r\nwere prepared. I called the Captain’s attention to the fact.\r\n\r\n“They will be useless,” he replied.\r\n\r\nI thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my\r\nobservation, for the Captain’s head had already disappeared in its\r\nmetal case. I finished harnessing myself. I felt them put an\r\niron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going\r\nthrough the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a\r\ndepth of 150 fathoms. Midnight was near. The waters were profoundly\r\ndark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a\r\nsort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the\r\n_Nautilus_. What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it\r\nlit up the liquid mass, I could not say. In any case, it did light our\r\nway, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar\r\ndarkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness\r\nof the Ruhmkorff apparatus.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head. The noise\r\nredoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood\r\nthe cause. It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of\r\nthe waves. Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I\r\nshould be wet through! By the water! in the midst of the water! I could\r\nnot help laughing at the odd idea. But, indeed, in the thick\r\ndiving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems\r\nto be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.\r\nNothing more.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour’s walk the soil became stony. Medusae, microscopic\r\ncrustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent\r\ngleam. I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of\r\nzoophytes and masses of sea weed. My feet often slipped upon this\r\nsticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should\r\nhave fallen more than once. In turning round, I could still see the\r\nwhitish lantern of the _Nautilus_ beginning to pale in the distance.\r\n\r\nBut the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.\r\nThe presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.\r\nWas I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the\r\n_savants_ of the earth? Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had\r\nthe hand of man aught to do with this conflagration? Had he fanned this\r\nflame? Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain\r\nNemo whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange\r\nexistence? Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary\r\nof the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence in the\r\ndeep ocean? All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued me. And in\r\nthis condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of wonders\r\ncontinually passing before my eyes, I should not have been surprised to\r\nmeet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which\r\nCaptain Nemo dreamed.\r\n\r\nOur road grew lighter and lighter. The white glimmer came in rays from\r\nthe summit of a mountain about 800 feet high. But what I saw was simply\r\na reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters. The source of\r\nthis inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,\r\nCaptain Nemo advanced without hesitation. He knew this dreary road.\r\nDoubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself. I\r\nfollowed him with unshaken confidence. He seemed to me like a genie of\r\nthe sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his\r\nstature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the\r\nmountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the\r\ndifficult paths of a vast copse.\r\n\r\nYes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees\r\npetrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by\r\ngigantic pines. It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the\r\nroots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper\r\ncuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling. Picture to yourself\r\na forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a\r\nforest swallowed up. The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,\r\nbetween which grovelled a whole world of crustacea. I went along,\r\nclimbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea\r\nbind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the\r\nfishes, which flew from branch to branch. Pressing onward, I felt no\r\nfatigue. I followed my guide, who was never tired. What a spectacle!\r\nHow can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in\r\nthis medium—their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with\r\nred tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters\r\ndoubled? We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic\r\nbounds and the low growling of an avalanche. To right and left ran\r\nlong, dark galleries, where sight was lost. Here opened vast glades\r\nwhich the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked\r\nmyself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly\r\nappear to me.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Nemo was still mounting. I could not stay behind. I\r\nfollowed boldly. My stick gave me good help. A false step would have\r\nbeen dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the\r\ngulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness. Now\r\nI jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had\r\nit been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady\r\ntrunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without\r\nlooking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\nThere, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed\r\nto defy all laws of equilibrium. From between their stony knees trees\r\nsprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld\r\nthem. Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a\r\n“curtain,” inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could\r\nnever have tolerated in terrestrial regions.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after quitting the _Nautilus_ we had crossed the line of\r\ntrees, and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain,\r\nwhich cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.\r\nSome petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there. Fishes got up\r\nunder our feet like birds in the long grass. The massive rocks were\r\nrent with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes,\r\nat the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving. My\r\nblood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some\r\nfrightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.\r\nMillions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.\r\nThey were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant\r\nlobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws\r\nwith the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun\r\non its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their\r\ntentacles like a living nest of serpents.\r\n\r\nWe had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited\r\nme. Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of\r\nman and not that of the Creator. There were vast heaps of stone,\r\namongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles\r\nand temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over\r\nwhich, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable\r\nmantle. But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed\r\nby cataclysms? Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of\r\nprehistoric times? Where was I? Whither had Captain Nemo’s fancy\r\nhurried me?\r\n\r\nI would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him—I seized\r\nhis arm. But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of\r\nthe mountain, he seemed to say:\r\n\r\n“Come, come along; come higher!”\r\n\r\nI followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a\r\ncircle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.\r\n\r\nI looked down the side we had just climbed. The mountain did not rise\r\nmore than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but\r\non the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of\r\nthis part of the Atlantic. My eyes ranged far over a large space lit by\r\na violent fulguration. In fact, the mountain was a volcano.\r\n\r\nAt fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and\r\nscoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell\r\nin a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass. Thus situated,\r\nthis volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the\r\nextreme limits of the horizon. I said that the submarine crater threw\r\nup lava, but no flames. Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed\r\nupon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having\r\nin themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white\r\nheat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to\r\nvapour by contact.\r\n\r\nRapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of\r\nlava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on\r\nanother Terra del Greco.\r\n\r\nThere indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town—its roofs\r\nopen to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns\r\nlying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive\r\ncharacter of Tuscan architecture. Further on, some remains of a\r\ngigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the\r\nfloating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an\r\nancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and\r\ndisappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on\r\nagain, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets—a perfect\r\nPompeii escaped beneath the waters. Such was the sight that Captain\r\nNemo brought before my eyes!\r\n\r\nWhere was I? Where was I? I must know at any cost. I tried to speak,\r\nbut Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of\r\nchalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one\r\nword:\r\n\r\nATLANTIS\r\n\r\nWhat a light shot through my mind! Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,\r\nthat continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its\r\ndisappearance amongst the legendary tales. I had it there now before my\r\neyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its catastrophe.\r\nThe region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and Lybia, beyond the\r\ncolumns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the Atlantides,\r\nlived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were waged.\r\n\r\nThus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the\r\nmountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a\r\nthousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs. I\r\nwas walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man\r\nhad walked.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand\r\nlandscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute\r\necstasy, leaning on a mossy stone. Was he dreaming of those generations\r\nlong since disappeared? Was he asking them the secret of human destiny?\r\nWas it here this strange man came to steep himself in historical\r\nrecollections, and live again this ancient life—he who wanted no modern\r\none? What would I not have given to know his thoughts, to share them,\r\nto understand them! We remained for an hour at this place,\r\ncontemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava, which\r\nwas some times wonderfully intense. Rapid tremblings ran along the\r\nmountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise, distinctly\r\ntransmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic\r\ngrandeur. At this moment the moon appeared through the mass of waters\r\nand threw her pale rays on the buried continent. It was but a gleam,\r\nbut what an indescribable effect! The Captain rose, cast one last look\r\non the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.\r\n\r\nWe descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,\r\nI saw the lantern of the _Nautilus_ shining like a star. The Captain\r\nwalked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light\r\nwhitened the surface of the ocean."

    "text": "CHAPTER X\r\nTHE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late: the fatigues of\r\nthe previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o’clock. I\r\ndressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the _Nautilus_ was\r\ntaking. The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a\r\nspeed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe species of fishes here did not differ much from those already\r\nnoticed. There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed\r\nwith great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the\r\nwaves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,\r\nwith triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost\r\ninvisible in the water.\r\n\r\nAmongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at\r\nthe upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,\r\nknown in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are\r\ndangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed\r\nwith petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and\r\nseemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling\r\nof lava. I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long\r\nplains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the _Nautilus_, I\r\nsaw the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close\r\nall exit. Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean. It must\r\nbe a continent, or at least an island—one of the Canaries, or of the\r\nCape Verde Islands. The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps\r\ndesignedly, I was ignorant of our exact position. In any case, such a\r\nwall seemed to me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had\r\nin reality passed over only the smallest part.\r\n\r\nMuch longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties\r\nof sea and sky, but the panels closed. At this moment the _Nautilus_\r\narrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall. What it would do,\r\nI could not guess. I returned to my room; it no longer moved. I laid\r\nmyself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours’ sleep;\r\nbut it was eight o’clock the next day when I entered the saloon. I\r\nlooked at the manometer. It told me that the _Nautilus_ was floating on\r\nthe surface of the ocean. Besides, I heard steps on the platform. I\r\nwent to the panel. It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I\r\nexpected, I was surrounded by profound darkness. Where were we? Was I\r\nmistaken? Was it still night? No; not a star was shining and night has\r\nnot that utter darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was floating near a mountain\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Professor?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Captain,” I answered, “where are we?”\r\n\r\n“Underground, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Underground!” I exclaimed. “And the _Nautilus_ floating still?”\r\n\r\n“It always floats.”\r\n\r\n“But I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light\r\nplaces, you will be satisfied.”\r\n\r\nI stood on the platform and waited. The darkness was so complete that I\r\ncould not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly\r\nabove my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight\r\nfilling a circular hole. At this instant the lantern was lit, and its\r\nvividness dispelled the faint light. I closed my dazzled eyes for an\r\ninstant, and then looked again. The _Nautilus_ was stationary, floating\r\nnear a mountain which formed a sort of quay. The lake, then, supporting\r\nit was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two miles in\r\ndiameter and six in circumference. Its level (the manometer showed)\r\ncould only be the same as the outside level, for there must necessarily\r\nbe a communication between the lake and the sea. The high partitions,\r\nleaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof bearing the\r\nshape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height being about\r\nfive or six hundred yards. At the summit was a circular orifice, by\r\nwhich I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently daylight.\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has\r\nbeen invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.\r\nWhilst you were sleeping, Professor, the _Nautilus_ penetrated to this\r\nlagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the\r\nsurface of the ocean. This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,\r\ncommodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales. Show me, if\r\nyou can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road\r\nwhich can give such perfect refuge from all storms.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” I replied, “you are in safety here, Captain Nemo. Who\r\ncould reach you in the heart of a volcano? But did I not see an opening\r\nat its summit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and\r\nwhich now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe.”\r\n\r\n“But what is this volcanic mountain?”\r\n\r\n“It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is\r\nstrewn—to vessels a simple sandbank—to us an immense cavern. Chance led\r\nme to discover it, and chance served me well.”\r\n\r\n“But of what use is this refuge, Captain? The _Nautilus_ wants no\r\nport.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal\r\nto make the electricity—sodium to feed the elements, coal from which to\r\nget the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal. And exactly on this\r\nspot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological\r\nperiods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an\r\ninexhaustible mine.”\r\n\r\n“Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. These mines extend under the waves like the mines of\r\nNewcastle. Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,\r\nmy men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the\r\nearth. When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the\r\nsmoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the\r\nappearance of a still-active volcano.”\r\n\r\n“And we shall see your companions at work?”\r\n\r\n“No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our\r\nsubmarine tour of the earth. So I shall content myself with drawing\r\nfrom the reserve of sodium I already possess. The time for loading is\r\none day only, and we continue our voyage. So, if you wish to go over\r\nthe cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of\r\nto-day, M. Aronnax.”\r\n\r\nI thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not\r\nyet left their cabin. I invited them to follow me without saying where\r\nwe were. They mounted the platform. Conseil, who was astonished at\r\nnothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake\r\nunder a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves. But Ned\r\nLand thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.\r\nAfter breakfast, about ten o’clock, we went down on to the mountain.\r\n\r\n“Here we are, once more on land,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“I do not call this land,” said the Canadian. “And besides, we are not\r\non it, but beneath it.”\r\n\r\nBetween the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a\r\nsandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.\r\nOn this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake. But the base\r\nof the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic blocks and\r\nenormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps. All these detached\r\nmasses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the\r\nsubterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric\r\nlantern. The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew like\r\na cloud of sparks. The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon arrived at\r\nlong circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us higher by\r\ndegrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these\r\nconglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy\r\ncrystal, felspar, and quartz.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all\r\nsides, and I pointed it out to my companions.\r\n\r\n“Picture to yourselves,” said I, “what this crater must have been when\r\nfilled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid\r\nrose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a\r\nhot plate.”\r\n\r\n“I can picture it perfectly,” said Conseil. “But, sir, will you tell me\r\nwhy the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that\r\nthe furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?”\r\n\r\n“Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean\r\nproduced that very opening which has served as a passage for the\r\n_Nautilus_. Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of\r\nthe mountain. There must have been a terrible struggle between the two\r\nelements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune. But many\r\nages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a\r\npeaceable grotto.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied Ned Land; “I accept the explanation, sir; but, in\r\nour own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not\r\nmade above the level of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“But, friend Ned,” said Conseil, “if the passage had not been under the\r\nsea, the _Nautilus_ could not have gone through it.”\r\n\r\nWe continued ascending. The steps became more and more perpendicular\r\nand narrow. Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them\r\nhere and there; sloping masses had to be turned. We slid upon our knees\r\nand crawled along. But Conseil’s dexterity and the Canadian’s strength\r\nsurmounted all obstacles. At a height of about 31 feet the nature of\r\nthe ground changed without becoming more practicable. To the\r\nconglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in\r\nlayers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like\r\na colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable\r\nspecimen of natural architecture. Between the blocks of basalt wound\r\nlong streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous\r\nrays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur. A\r\nmore powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague\r\nglimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of\r\nthis extinguished mountain. But our upward march was soon stopped at a\r\nheight of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.\r\nThere was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was\r\nchanged to a circular walk. At the last change vegetable life began to\r\nstruggle with the mineral. Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from\r\nthe fractures of the walls. I recognised some euphorbias, with the\r\ncaustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of\r\njustifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both\r\ntheir colour and perfume half gone. Here and there some chrysanthemums\r\ngrew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.\r\nBut between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still\r\nslightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight. Perfume\r\nis the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.\r\n\r\nWe had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had\r\npushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!”\r\n\r\n“A hive!” I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a hive,” repeated the Canadian, “and bees humming round it.”\r\n\r\nI approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes. There at a hole\r\nbored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious\r\ninsects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much\r\nesteemed. Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,\r\nand I could not well oppose his wish. A quantity of dry leaves, mixed\r\nwith sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke\r\nout the bees. The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually\r\nyielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land\r\nfilled his haversack.\r\n\r\n“When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the artocarpus,” said\r\nhe, “I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake.”\r\n\r\n“’Pon my word,” said Conseil, “it will be gingerbread.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the gingerbread,” said I; “let us continue our interesting\r\nwalk.”\r\n\r\nAt every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all\r\nits length and breadth. The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable\r\nsurface, which knew neither ripple nor wave. The _Nautilus_ remained\r\nperfectly immovable. On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship’s\r\ncrew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the\r\nluminous atmosphere. We were now going round the highest crest of the\r\nfirst layers of rock which upheld the roof. I then saw that bees were\r\nnot the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of\r\nthis volcano. Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or\r\nfled from their nests on the top of the rocks. There were sparrow\r\nhawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,\r\nwith their long legs, several fine fat bustards. I leave anyone to\r\nimagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury\r\ngame, and whether he did not regret having no gun. But he did his best\r\nto replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,\r\nhe succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird. To say that he risked his\r\nlife twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed\r\nso well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag. We were\r\nnow obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming\r\nimpracticable. Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a\r\nwell. From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,\r\ndissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of\r\nthe mountain, their misty remnants—certain proof that they were only\r\nmoderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the ocean. Half an hour after the Canadian’s\r\nlast exploit we had regained the inner shore. Here the flora was\r\nrepresented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous\r\nplant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone\r\nand sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it. As to the fauna,\r\nit might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,\r\ncrabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,\r\nrockfish, and limpets. Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished\r\nour circuitous walk and were on board. The crew had just finished\r\nloading the sodium, and the _Nautilus_ could have left that instant.\r\nBut Captain Nemo gave no order. Did he wish to wait until night, and\r\nleave the submarine passage secretly? Perhaps so. Whatever it might be,\r\nthe next day, the _Nautilus_, having left its port, steered clear of\r\nall land at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic."

    "title": "CHAPTER XI. THE SARGASSO SEA",
    "text": "CHAPTER XI\r\nTHE SARGASSO SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day the _Nautilus_ crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nNo one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water\r\nknown by the name of the Gulf Stream. After leaving the Gulf of\r\nFlorida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen. But before entering\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into two\r\narms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and Norway,\r\nwhilst the second bends to the south about the height of the Azores;\r\nthen, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened oval,\r\nreturns to the Antilles. This second arm—it is rather a collar than an\r\narm—surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the cold,\r\nquiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect lake in the\r\nopen Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the great current\r\nto pass round it. Such was the region the _Nautilus_ was now visiting,\r\na perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and tropical\r\nberries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly\r\ntear its way through it. And Captain Nemo, not wishing to entangle his\r\nscrew in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the surface of\r\nthe waves. The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word “sargazzo”\r\nwhich signifies kelp. This kelp, or berry-plant, is the principal\r\nformation of this immense bank. And this is the reason why these plants\r\nunite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic. The only explanation which\r\ncan be given, he says, seems to me to result from the experience known\r\nto all the world. Place in a vase some fragments of cork or other\r\nfloating body, and give to the water in the vase a circular movement,\r\nthe scattered fragments will unite in a group in the centre of the\r\nliquid surface, that is to say, in the part least agitated. In the\r\nphenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the vase, the Gulf\r\nStream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the central point at\r\nwhich the floating bodies unite.\r\n\r\nI share Maury’s opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the\r\nvery midst, where vessels rarely penetrate. Above us floated products\r\nof all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees\r\ntorn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon\r\nor the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships’\r\nbottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and\r\nbarnacles that they could not again rise to the surface. And time will\r\none day justify Maury’s other opinion, that these substances thus\r\naccumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water\r\nand will then form inexhaustible coal-mines—a precious reserve prepared\r\nby far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have exhausted the\r\nmines of continents.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I\r\nnoticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long\r\ntentacles trailing after them, and medusæ, green, red, and blue.\r\n\r\nAll the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,\r\nwhere such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant\r\nnourishment. The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed aspect.\r\nFrom this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to the 12th\r\nof March, the _Nautilus_ kept in the middle of the Atlantic, carrying\r\nus at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four hours.\r\nCaptain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine programme,\r\nand I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn, to return to\r\nthe Australian seas of the Pacific. Ned Land had cause for fear. In\r\nthese large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt to leave the\r\nboat. Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo’s will. Our only\r\ncourse was to submit; but what we could neither gain by force nor\r\ncunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion. This voyage\r\nended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under an oath never\r\nto reveal his existence?—an oath of honour which we should have\r\nreligiously kept. But we must consider that delicate question with the\r\nCaptain. But was I free to claim this liberty? Had he not himself said\r\nfrom the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the secret of his life\r\nexacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the _Nautilus?_ And\r\nwould not my four months’ silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of\r\nour situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising\r\nsuspicions which might be hurtful to our projects, if at some future\r\ntime a favourable opportunity offered to return to them?\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind\r\nhappened to signalise our voyage. I saw little of the Captain; he was\r\nat work. In the library I often found his books left open, especially\r\nthose on natural history. My work on submarine depths, conned over by\r\nhim, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories\r\nand systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my\r\nwork; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me. Sometimes I heard\r\nthe melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the midst of\r\nthe deepest obscurity, when the _Nautilus_ slept upon the deserted\r\nocean. During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on the\r\nsurface of the waves. The sea seemed abandoned. A few sailing-vessels,\r\non the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good Hope. One day we\r\nwere followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no doubt, took us for some\r\nenormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo did not wish the worthy\r\nfellows to lose their time and trouble, so ended the chase by plunging\r\nunder the water. Our navigation continued until the 13th of March; that\r\nday the _Nautilus_ was employed in taking soundings, which greatly\r\ninterested me. We had then made about 13,000 leagues since our\r\ndeparture from the high seas of the Pacific. The bearings gave us 45°\r\n37′ S. lat., and 37° 53′ W. long. It was the same water in which\r\nCaptain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000 fathoms without finding the\r\nbottom. There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of the American frigate\r\nCongress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140 fathoms. Captain Nemo\r\nintended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a diagonal sufficiently\r\nlengthened by means of lateral planes placed at an angle of 45° with\r\nthe water-line of the _Nautilus_. Then the screw set to work at its\r\nmaximum speed, its four blades beating the waves with in describable\r\nforce. Under this powerful pressure, the hull of the _Nautilus_\r\nquivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly under the water.\r\n\r\nAt 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the\r\nwaters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the\r\nHimalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss\r\nremained incalculable. The _Nautilus_ descended still lower, in spite\r\nof the great pressure. I felt the steel plates tremble at the\r\nfastenings of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the\r\nwindows of the saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.\r\nAnd this firm structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its\r\nCaptain had said, it had not been capable of resistance like a solid\r\nblock. We had attained a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the\r\nsides of the _Nautilus_ then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that\r\nis to say, 3,200 lbs. to each square two-fifths of an inch of its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n“What a situation to be in!” I exclaimed. “To overrun these deep\r\nregions where man has never trod! Look, Captain, look at these\r\nmagnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles\r\nof the globe, where life is no longer possible! What unknown sights are\r\nhere! Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?” said Captain\r\nNemo.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by those words?”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view\r\nof this submarine region.”\r\n\r\nI had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at\r\nCaptain Nemo’s call, an objective was brought into the saloon. Through\r\nthe widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,\r\nwhich was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a\r\ngradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light. The _Nautilus_\r\nremained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination\r\nof its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic\r\nsite, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.\r\n\r\nBut, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, “Let us go up; we\r\nmust not abuse our position, nor expose the _Nautilus_ too long to such\r\ngreat pressure.”\r\n\r\n“Go up again!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Hold well on.”\r\n\r\nI had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I\r\nwas thrown forward on to the carpet. At a signal from the Captain, its\r\nscrew was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the _Nautilus_\r\nshot into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and\r\ncutting the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation. Nothing was\r\nvisible; and in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which\r\nseparated it from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish,\r\nfell, making the waves rebound to an enormous height."

    "title": "CHAPTER XII. CACHALOTS AND WHALES",
    "text": "CHAPTER XII\r\nCACHALOTS AND WHALES\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the _Nautilus_\r\nreturned to its southerly course. I fancied that, when on a level with\r\nCape Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the\r\nPacific seas, and so complete the tour of the world. He did nothing of\r\nthe kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions. Where was\r\nhe going to? To the pole? It was madness! I began to think that the\r\nCaptain’s temerity justified Ned Land’s fears. For some time past the\r\nCanadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less\r\ncommunicative, almost silent. I could see that this lengthened\r\nimprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning\r\nwithin him. When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed\r\nanger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some\r\nextreme. That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my\r\nroom. I inquired the cause of their visit.\r\n\r\n“A simple question to ask you, sir,” replied the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Speak, Ned.”\r\n\r\n“How many men are there on board the _Nautilus_, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I should say that its working does not require a large crew.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to\r\nbe enough.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why should there be any more?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy\r\nto guess. “Because,” I added, “if my surmises are correct, and if I\r\nhave well understood the Captain’s existence, the _Nautilus_ is not\r\nonly a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its\r\ncommander, have broken every tie upon earth.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” said Conseil; “but, in any case, the _Nautilus_ can only\r\ncontain a certain number of men. Could not you, sir, estimate their\r\nmaximum?”\r\n\r\n“How, Conseil?”\r\n\r\n“By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and\r\nconsequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much\r\neach man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact\r\nthat the _Nautilus_ is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\nConseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving\r\nat.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said I; “but that calculation, though simple enough,\r\ncan give but a very uncertain result.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Ned Land urgently.\r\n\r\n“Here it is, then,” said I. “In one hour each man consumes the oxygen\r\ncontained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained\r\nin 480 gallons. We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of\r\nair the _Nautilus_ contains.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Or,” I continued, “the size of the _Nautilus_ being 1,500 tons; and\r\none ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,\r\ndivided by 480, gives a quotient of 625. Which means to say, strictly\r\nspeaking, that the air contained in the _Nautilus_ would suffice for\r\n625 men for twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“Six hundred and twenty-five!” repeated Ned.\r\n\r\n“But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers\r\nincluded, would not form a tenth part of that number.”\r\n\r\n“Still too many for three men,” murmured Conseil.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and\r\nleft the room without answering.\r\n\r\n“Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?” said Conseil. “Poor\r\nNed is longing for everything that he can not have. His past life is\r\nalways present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets. His\r\nhead is full of old recollections. And we must understand him. What has\r\nhe to do here? Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and has not\r\nthe same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have. He would risk\r\neverything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his own\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nCertainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,\r\naccustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity. Events were\r\nrare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event\r\ndid happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner. About\r\neleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the\r\n_Nautilus_ fell in with a troop of whales—an encounter which did not\r\nastonish me, knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken\r\nrefuge in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nWe were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea. The month of October\r\nin those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days. It was the\r\nCanadian—he could not be mistaken—who signalled a whale on the eastern\r\nhorizon. Looking attentively, one might see its black back rise and\r\nfall with the waves five miles from the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Ned Land, “if I was on board a whaler, now such a\r\nmeeting would give me pleasure. It is one of large size. See with what\r\nstrength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam! Confound it,\r\nwhy am I bound to these steel plates?”\r\n\r\n“What, Ned,” said I, “you have not forgotten your old ideas of\r\nfishing?”\r\n\r\n“Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir? Can he ever tire of\r\nthe emotions caused by such a chase?”\r\n\r\n“You have never fished in these seas, Ned?”\r\n\r\n“Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis\r\nStraits.”\r\n\r\n“Then the southern whale is still unknown to you. It is the Greenland\r\nwhale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing\r\nthrough the warm waters of the equator. Whales are localised, according\r\nto their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave. And if one of\r\nthese creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must be simply\r\nbecause there is a passage from one sea to the other, either on the\r\nAmerican or the Asiatic side.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the\r\nkind of whale frequenting them!”\r\n\r\n“I have told you, Ned.”\r\n\r\n“A greater reason for making their acquaintance,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Look! look!” exclaimed the Canadian, “they approach: they aggravate\r\nme; they know that I cannot get at them!”\r\n\r\nNed stamped his feet. His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary\r\nharpoon.\r\n\r\n“Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Very nearly, Ned.”\r\n\r\n“Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred\r\nfeet. I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of\r\nthe Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only\r\nbalaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are\r\ngenerally much smaller than the Greenland whale.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,\r\n“they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\nThen, returning to the conversation, he said:\r\n\r\n“You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature. I have heard of\r\ngigantic ones. They are intelligent cetacea. It is said of some that\r\nthey cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for\r\nislands. People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire——”\r\n\r\n“And build houses,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Yes, joker,” said Ned Land. “And one fine day the creature plunges,\r\ncarrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor,” I replied, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, “it is not one whale; there are\r\nten—there are twenty—it is a whole troop! And I not able to do\r\nanything! hands and feet tied!”\r\n\r\n“But, friend Ned,” said Conseil, “why do you not ask Captain Nemo’s\r\npermission to chase them?”\r\n\r\nConseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself\r\nthrough the panel to seek the Captain. A few minutes afterwards the two\r\nappeared together on the platform.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a\r\nmile from the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\n“They are southern whales,” said he; “there goes the fortune of a whole\r\nfleet of whalers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” asked the Canadian, “can I not chase them, if only to\r\nremind me of my old trade of harpooner?”\r\n\r\n“And to what purpose?” replied Captain Nemo; “only to destroy! We have\r\nnothing to do with the whale-oil on board.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” continued the Canadian, “in the Red Sea you allowed us to\r\nfollow the dugong.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew. Here it would be\r\nkilling for killing’s sake. I know that is a privilege reserved for\r\nman, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime. In destroying the\r\nsouthern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),\r\nyour traders do a culpable action, Master Land. They have already\r\ndepopulated the whole of Baffin’s Bay, and are annihilating a class of\r\nuseful animals. Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone. They have plenty\r\nof natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish—without you\r\ntroubling them.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain was right. The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these\r\nfishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the\r\nocean. Ned Land whistled “Yankee-doodle” between his teeth, thrust his\r\nhands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us. But Captain Nemo\r\nwatched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:\r\n\r\n“I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without\r\ncounting man. These will have plenty to do before long. Do you see, M.\r\nAronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Captain,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Those are cachalots—terrible animals, which I have met in troops of\r\ntwo or three hundred. As to those, they are cruel, mischievous\r\ncreatures; they would be right in exterminating them.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian turned quickly at the last words.\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain,” said he, “it is still time, in the interest of the\r\nwhales.”\r\n\r\n“It is useless to expose one’s self, Professor. The _Nautilus_ will\r\ndisperse them. It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land’s\r\nharpoon, I imagine.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders.\r\nAttack cetacea with blows of a spur! Who had ever heard of such a\r\nthing?\r\n\r\n“Wait, M. Aronnax,” said Captain Nemo. “We will show you something you\r\nhave never yet seen. We have no pity for these ferocious creatures.\r\nThey are nothing but mouth and teeth.”\r\n\r\nMouth and teeth! No one could better describe the macrocephalous\r\ncachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long. Its\r\nenormous head occupies one-third of its entire body. Better armed than\r\nthe whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is\r\nsupplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,\r\ncylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds. It is in\r\nthe upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by\r\ncartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of\r\nthat precious oil called spermaceti. The cachalot is a disagreeable\r\ncreature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol’s description. It\r\nis badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say it), a\r\n“failure,” and being only able to see with its right eye. But the\r\nformidable troop was nearing us. They had seen the whales and were\r\npreparing to attack them. One could judge beforehand that the cachalots\r\nwould be victorious, not only because they were better built for attack\r\nthan their inoffensive adversaries, but also because they could remain\r\nlonger under water without coming to the surface. There was only just\r\ntime to go to the help of the whales. The _Nautilus_ went under water.\r\nConseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the window in the\r\nsaloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to work his\r\napparatus as an engine of destruction. Soon I felt the beatings of the\r\nscrew quicken, and our speed increased. The battle between the\r\ncachalots and the whales had already begun when the _Nautilus_ arrived.\r\nThey did not at first show any fear at the sight of this new monster\r\njoining in the conflict. But they soon had to guard against its blows.\r\nWhat a battle! The _Nautilus_ was nothing but a formidable harpoon,\r\nbrandished by the hand of its Captain. It hurled itself against the\r\nfleshy mass, passing through from one part to the other, leaving behind\r\nit two quivering halves of the animal. It could not feel the formidable\r\nblows from their tails upon its sides, nor the shock which it produced\r\nitself, much more. One cachalot killed, it ran at the next, tacked on\r\nthe spot that it might not miss its prey, going forwards and backwards,\r\nanswering to its helm, plunging when the cetacean dived into the deep\r\nwaters, coming up with it when it returned to the surface, striking it\r\nfront or sideways, cutting or tearing in all directions and at any\r\npace, piercing it with its terrible spur. What carnage! What a noise on\r\nthe surface of the waves! What sharp hissing, and what snorting\r\npeculiar to these enraged animals! In the midst of these waters,\r\ngenerally so peaceful, their tails made perfect billows. For one hour\r\nthis wholesale massacre continued, from which the cachalots could not\r\nescape. Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the\r\n_Nautilus_ by their weight. From the window we could see their enormous\r\nmouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable eyes. Ned Land could\r\nnot contain himself; he threatened and swore at them. We could feel\r\nthem clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a wild boar in a copse.\r\nBut the _Nautilus_, working its screw, carried them here and there, or\r\nto the upper levels of the ocean, without caring for their enormous\r\nweight, nor the powerful strain on the vessel. At length the mass of\r\ncachalots broke up, the waves became quiet, and I felt that we were\r\nrising to the surface. The panel opened, and we hurried on to the\r\nplatform. The sea was covered with mutilated bodies. A formidable\r\nexplosion could not have divided and torn this fleshy mass with more\r\nviolence. We were floating amid gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and\r\nwhite underneath, covered with enormous protuberances. Some terrified\r\ncachalots were flying towards the horizon. The waves were dyed red for\r\nseveral miles, and the _Nautilus_ floated in a sea of blood: Captain\r\nNemo joined us.\r\n\r\n“Well, Master Land?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat\r\ncalmed; “it is a terrible spectacle, certainly. But I am not a butcher.\r\nI am a hunter, and I call this a butchery.”\r\n\r\n“It is a massacre of mischievous creatures,” replied the Captain; “and\r\nthe _Nautilus_ is not a butcher’s knife.”\r\n\r\n“I like my harpoon better,” said the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Every one to his own,” answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nI feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad\r\nconsequences. But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which\r\nthe _Nautilus_ had just come up with. The creature had not quite\r\nescaped from the cachalot’s teeth. I recognised the southern whale by\r\nits flat head, which is entirely black. Anatomically, it is\r\ndistinguished from the white whale and the North Cape whale by the\r\nseven cervical vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.\r\nThe unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from\r\nthe bites, and quite dead. From its mutilated fin still hung a young\r\nwhale which it could not save from the massacre. Its open mouth let the\r\nwater flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.\r\nCaptain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature. Two of his\r\nmen mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were\r\ndrawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to\r\nsay, about two or three tons. The Captain offered me a cup of the milk,\r\nwhich was still warm. I could not help showing my repugnance to the\r\ndrink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be\r\ndistinguished from cow’s milk. I tasted it, and was of his opinion. It\r\nwas a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or cheese\r\nit would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food. From that\r\nday I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land’s ill-will towards Captain\r\nNemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian’s gestures\r\nclosely."

    "title": "CHAPTER XIII. THE ICEBERG",
    "text": "CHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE ICEBERG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following\r\nthe fiftieth meridian with considerable speed. Did he wish to reach the\r\npole? I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had\r\nhitherto failed. Again, the season was far advanced, for in the\r\nAntarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of\r\nSeptember of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.\r\nOn the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely pale\r\nbits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks over\r\nwhich the sea curled. The _Nautilus_ remained on the surface of the\r\nocean. Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with\r\nits icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time. In the\r\natmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling\r\nband. English whalers have given it the name of “ice blink.” However\r\nthick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the\r\npresence of an ice pack or bank. Accordingly, larger blocks soon\r\nappeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog. Some\r\nof these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had\r\nbeen traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous\r\namethysts with the light shining through them. Some reflected the light\r\nof day upon a thousand crystal facets. Others shaded with vivid\r\ncalcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble. The more we\r\nneared the south the more these floating islands increased both in\r\nnumber and importance.\r\n\r\nAt 60° lat. every pass had disappeared. But, seeking carefully, Captain\r\nNemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly slipped,\r\nknowing, however, that it would close behind him. Thus, guided by this\r\nclever hand, the _Nautilus_ passed through all the ice with a precision\r\nwhich quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains, ice-fields or\r\nsmooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or floating\r\nice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are circular, and\r\nstreams when they are made up of long strips. The temperature was very\r\nlow; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2 deg. or 3° below zero,\r\nbut we were warmly clad with fur, at the expense of the sea-bear and\r\nseal. The interior of the _Nautilus_, warmed regularly by its electric\r\napparatus, defied the most intense cold. Besides, it would only have\r\nbeen necessary to go some yards beneath the waves to find a more\r\nbearable temperature. Two months earlier we should have had perpetual\r\ndaylight in these latitudes; but already we had had three or four hours\r\nof night, and by and by there would be six months of darkness in these\r\ncircumpolar regions. On the 15th of March we were in the latitude of\r\nNew Shetland and South Orkney. The Captain told me that formerly\r\nnumerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that English and American\r\nwhalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred both old and young;\r\nthus, where there was once life and animation, they had left silence\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock on the morning of the 16th of March the _Nautilus_,\r\nfollowing the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle. Ice\r\nsurrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon. But Captain Nemo\r\nwent from one opening to another, still going higher. I cannot express\r\nmy astonishment at the beauties of these new regions. The ice took most\r\nsurprising forms. Here the grouping formed an oriental town, with\r\ninnumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to the\r\nearth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature. The whole aspect was\r\nconstantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the\r\ngreyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow. Detonations and falls were heard\r\non all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the whole\r\nlandscape like a diorama. Often seeing no exit, I thought we were\r\ndefinitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest\r\nindication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass. He was never\r\nmistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along\r\nthe ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into\r\nthe midst of these Antarctic seas before. On the 16th of March,\r\nhowever, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road. It was not the\r\niceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold. But this\r\nobstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with\r\nfrightful violence. The _Nautilus_ entered the brittle mass like a\r\nwedge, and split it with frightful crackings. It was the battering ram\r\nof the ancients hurled by infinite strength. The ice, thrown high in\r\nthe air, fell like hail around us. By its own power of impulsion our\r\napparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own\r\nimpetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and\r\nsometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,\r\nproducing large rents in it. Violent gales assailed us at this time,\r\naccompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform\r\nto the other, we could see nothing. The wind blew sharply from all\r\nparts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had\r\nto break it with blows of a pickaxe. The temperature was always at 5\r\ndeg. below zero; every outward part of the _Nautilus_ was covered with\r\nice. A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up\r\ngorges. A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,\r\nand wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes. At length,\r\non the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the _Nautilus_ was\r\npositively blocked. It was no longer either streams, packs, or\r\nice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by\r\nmountains soldered together.\r\n\r\n“An iceberg!” said the Canadian to me.\r\n\r\nI knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had\r\npreceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle. The sun appearing for an\r\ninstant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,\r\nwhich gave our situation at 51° 30′ long. and 67° 39′ of S. lat. We had\r\nadvanced one degree more in this Antarctic region. Of the liquid\r\nsurface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse. Under the spur of the\r\n_Nautilus_ lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with confused blocks.\r\nHere and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of\r\n200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it were with an axe and\r\nclothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors, reflecting a few rays of\r\nsunshine, half drowned in the fog. And over this desolate face of\r\nnature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken by the flapping of the\r\nwings of petrels and puffins. Everything was frozen—even the noise. The\r\n_Nautilus_ was then obliged to stop in its adventurous course amid\r\nthese fields of ice. In spite of our efforts, in spite of the powerful\r\nmeans employed to break up the ice, the _Nautilus_ remained immovable.\r\nGenerally, when we can proceed no further, we have return still open to\r\nus; but here return was as impossible as advance, for every pass had\r\nclosed behind us; and for the few moments when we were stationary, we\r\nwere likely to be entirely blocked, which did indeed happen about two\r\no’clock in the afternoon, the fresh ice forming around its sides with\r\nastonishing rapidity. I was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more\r\nthan imprudent. I was on the platform at that moment. The Captain had\r\nbeen observing our situation for some time past, when he said to me:\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, what do you think of this?”\r\n\r\n“I think that we are caught, Captain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was blocked up\r\n\r\n\r\n“So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the _Nautilus_ cannot disengage\r\nitself?”\r\n\r\n“With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced\r\nfor you to reckon on the breaking of the ice.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir,” said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, “you will always be\r\nthe same. You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles. I affirm that\r\nnot only can the _Nautilus_ disengage itself, but also that it can go\r\nfurther still.”\r\n\r\n“Further to the South?” I asked, looking at the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole.”\r\n\r\n“To the pole!” I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Captain, coldly, “to the Antarctic pole—to that\r\nunknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe. You know\r\nwhether I can do as I please with the _Nautilus!_”\r\n\r\nYes, I knew that. I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness. But\r\nto conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,\r\nrendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been\r\nreached by the boldest navigators—was it not a mad enterprise, one\r\nwhich only a maniac would have conceived? It then came into my head to\r\nask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never\r\nyet been trodden by a human creature?\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” he replied; “but we will discover it together. Where others\r\nhave failed, I will not fail. I have never yet led my _Nautilus_ so far\r\ninto southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet.”\r\n\r\n“I can well believe you, Captain,” said I, in a slightly ironical tone.\r\n“I believe you! Let us go ahead! There are no obstacles for us! Let us\r\nsmash this iceberg! Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us give\r\nthe _Nautilus_ wings to fly over it!”\r\n\r\n“Over it, sir!” said Captain Nemo, quietly; “no, not over it, but under\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“Under it!” I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain’s projects\r\nflashing upon my mind. I understood; the wonderful qualities of the\r\n_Nautilus_ were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.\r\n\r\n“I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir,” said the\r\nCaptain, half smiling. “You begin to see the possibility—I should say\r\nthe success—of this attempt. That which is impossible for an ordinary\r\nvessel is easy to the _Nautilus_. If a continent lies before the pole,\r\nit must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is\r\nwashed by open sea, it will go even to the pole.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said I, carried away by the Captain’s reasoning; “if the\r\nsurface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free\r\nby the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the\r\nwaters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am\r\nnot mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is\r\nas one to four to that which is below.”\r\n\r\n“Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are\r\nthree below it. If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet above\r\nthe surface, they are not more than 900 beneath. And what are 900 feet\r\nto the _Nautilus?_”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir.”\r\n\r\n“It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of\r\nsea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of\r\nsurface cold.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, sir—just so,” I replied, getting animated.\r\n\r\n“The only difficulty,” continued Captain Nemo, “is that of remaining\r\nseveral days without renewing our provision of air.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all? The _Nautilus_ has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and\r\nthey will supply us with all the oxygen we want.”\r\n\r\n“Well thought of, M. Aronnax,” replied the Captain, smiling. “But, not\r\nwishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my\r\nobjections.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any more to make?”\r\n\r\n“Only one. It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that it\r\nmay be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the\r\nsurface.”\r\n\r\n“Good, sir! but do you forget that the _Nautilus_ is armed with a\r\npowerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields\r\nof ice, which would open at the shocks.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, Captain,” I added, enthusiastically, “why should we not find\r\nthe sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North? The frozen\r\npoles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the\r\nnorthern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may\r\nsuppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two\r\npoints of the globe.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo. “I only wish you to\r\nobserve that, after having made so many objections to my project, you\r\nare now crushing me with arguments in its favour!”\r\n\r\nThe preparations for this audacious attempt now began. The powerful\r\npumps of the _Nautilus_ were working air into the reservoirs and\r\nstoring it at high pressure. About four o’clock, Captain Nemo announced\r\nthe closing of the panels on the platform. I threw one last look at the\r\nmassive iceberg which we were going to cross. The weather was clear,\r\nthe atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below zero;\r\nbut, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so unbearable.\r\nAbout ten men mounted the sides of the _Nautilus_, armed with pickaxes\r\nto break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free. The operation\r\nwas quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very thin. We all\r\nwent below. The usual reservoirs were filled with the newly-liberated\r\nwater, and the _Nautilus_ soon descended. I had taken my place with\r\nConseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see the lower\r\nbeds of the Southern Ocean. The thermometer went up, the needle of the\r\ncompass deviated on the dial. At about 900 feet, as Captain Nemo had\r\nforeseen, we were floating beneath the undulating bottom of the\r\niceberg. But the _Nautilus_ went lower still—it went to the depth of\r\nfour hundred fathoms. The temperature of the water at the surface\r\nshowed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two. I need\r\nnot say the temperature of the _Nautilus_ was raised by its heating\r\napparatus to a much higher degree; every manœuvre was accomplished with\r\nwonderful precision.\r\n\r\n“We shall pass it, if you please, sir,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“I believe we shall,” I said, in a tone of firm conviction.\r\n\r\nIn this open sea, the _Nautilus_ had taken its course direct to the\r\npole, without leaving the fifty-second meridian. From 67° 30′ to 90\r\ndeg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;\r\nthat is, about five hundred leagues. The _Nautilus_ kept up a mean\r\nspeed of twenty-six miles an hour—the speed of an express train. If\r\nthat was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.\r\n\r\nFor a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the\r\nwindow. The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was deserted;\r\nfishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only found\r\nthere a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open polar\r\nsea. Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of the long\r\nsteel body. About two in the morning I took some hours’ repose, and\r\nConseil did the same. In crossing the waist I did not meet Captain\r\nNemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot’s cage. The next morning, the\r\n19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon. The electric log\r\ntold me that the speed of the _Nautilus_ had been slackened. It was\r\nthen going towards the surface; but prudently emptying its reservoirs\r\nvery slowly. My heart beat fast. Were we going to emerge and regain the\r\nopen polar atmosphere? No! A shock told me that the _Nautilus_ had\r\nstruck the bottom of the iceberg, still very thick, judging from the\r\ndeadened sound. We had in deed “struck,” to use a sea expression, but\r\nin an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. This would give three\r\nthousand feet of ice above us; one thousand being above the water-mark.\r\nThe iceberg was then higher than at its borders—not a very reassuring\r\nfact. Several times that day the _Nautilus_ tried again, and every time\r\nit struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it. Sometimes it met\r\nwith but 900 yards, only 200 of which rose above the surface. It was\r\ntwice the height it was when the _Nautilus_ had gone under the waves. I\r\ncarefully noted the different depths, and thus obtained a submarine\r\nprofile of the chain as it was developed under the water. That night no\r\nchange had taken place in our situation. Still ice between four and\r\nfive hundred yards in depth! It was evidently diminishing, but, still,\r\nwhat a thickness between us and the surface of the ocean! It was then\r\neight. According to the daily custom on board the _Nautilus_, its air\r\nshould have been renewed four hours ago; but I did not suffer much,\r\nalthough Captain Nemo had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of\r\noxygen. My sleep was painful that night; hope and fear besieged me by\r\nturns: I rose several times. The groping of the _Nautilus_ continued.\r\nAbout three in the morning, I noticed that the lower surface of the\r\niceberg was only about fifty feet deep. One hundred and fifty feet now\r\nseparated us from the surface of the waters. The iceberg was by degrees\r\nbecoming an ice-field, the mountain a plain. My eyes never left the\r\nmanometer. We were still rising diagonally to the surface, which\r\nsparkled under the electric rays. The iceberg was stretching both above\r\nand beneath into lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting\r\nthinner. At length, at six in the morning of that memorable day, the\r\n19th of March, the door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“The sea is open!” was all he said."

    "title": "CHAPTER XIV. THE SOUTH POLE",
    "text": "CHAPTER XIV\r\nTHE SOUTH POLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI rushed on to the platform. Yes! the open sea, with but a few\r\nscattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs—a long stretch of sea; a\r\nworld of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,\r\nwhich varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.\r\nThe thermometer marked 3° C. above zero. It was comparatively spring,\r\nshut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass was dimly\r\nseen on our northern horizon.\r\n\r\n“Are we at the pole?” I asked the Captain, with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” he replied. “At noon I will take our bearings.”\r\n\r\n“But will the sun show himself through this fog?” said I, looking at\r\nthe leaden sky.\r\n\r\n“However little it shows, it will be enough,” replied the Captain.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred\r\nand four yards. We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be\r\nstrewn with banks. One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours\r\nlater we had made the round of it. It measured four or five miles in\r\ncircumference. A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch\r\nof land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits. The\r\nexistence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury’s theory.\r\nThe ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and\r\nthe sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous\r\nsize, which is never met with in the North Atlantic. From this fact he\r\nhas drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses\r\nconsiderable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only\r\non the coasts. According to these calculations, the mass of ice\r\nsurrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of\r\nwhich must be, at least, 2,500 miles. But the _Nautilus_, for fear of\r\nrunning aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand\r\nover which reared a superb heap of rocks. The boat was launched; the\r\nCaptain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were\r\nin it. It was ten in the morning. I had not seen Ned Land. Doubtless\r\nthe Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole. A\r\nfew strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.\r\nConseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said I to Captain Nemo, “to you belongs the honour of first\r\nsetting foot on this land.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said the Captain, “and if I do not hesitate to tread this\r\nSouth Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a\r\ntrace there.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand. His heart beat with\r\nemotion. He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,\r\nwith his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he\r\nseemed to take possession of these southern regions. After five minutes\r\npassed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.\r\n\r\n“When you like, sir.”\r\n\r\nI landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat. For a\r\nlong way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like\r\ncrushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could\r\nnot mistake its volcanic origin. In some parts, slight curls of smoke\r\nemitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost\r\nnothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high\r\nacclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles. We\r\nknow that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,\r\nthe Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,\r\nlatitude 77° 32′. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to\r\nme much restricted. Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some\r\nmicroscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed\r\nbetween two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on\r\nlittle swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to\r\nthe shore. These constituted the meagre flora of this region. The shore\r\nwas strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets. I also saw\r\nmyriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which a\r\nwhale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect\r\nsea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.\r\n\r\nThere appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind\r\nwhich, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth\r\nof more than 1,000 yards. Then there were little kingfishers and\r\nstarfish studding the soil. But where life abounded most was in the\r\nair. There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,\r\ndeafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us\r\nas we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our\r\nfeet. There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as\r\nthey are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large\r\nassembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour. Albatrosses\r\npassed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards\r\nand a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic\r\npetrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose\r\nbody is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,\r\nsome whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the\r\nAntarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of\r\nthe Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a\r\nwick in.\r\n\r\n“A little more,” said Conseil, “and they would be perfect lamps! After\r\nthat, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with\r\nwicks!”\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs’ nests, a\r\nsort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing. Captain\r\nNemo had some hundreds hunted. They uttered a cry like the braying of\r\nan ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white\r\nbeneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed\r\nthemselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape. But the\r\nfog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself. Its\r\nabsence made me uneasy. Without it no observations were possible. How,\r\nthen, could we decide whether we had reached the pole? When I rejoined\r\nCaptain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently watching\r\nthe sky. He seemed impatient and vexed. But what was to be done? This\r\nrash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did the sea. Noon\r\narrived without the orb of day showing itself for an instant. We could\r\nnot even tell its position behind the curtain of fog; and soon the fog\r\nturned to snow.\r\n\r\n“Till to-morrow,” said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the\r\n_Nautilus_ amid these atmospheric disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe tempest of snow continued till the next day. It was impossible to\r\nremain on the platform. From the saloon, where I was taking notes of\r\nincidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I\r\ncould hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst\r\nof this violent storm. The _Nautilus_ did not remain motionless, but\r\nskirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the\r\nhalf-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon. The\r\nnext day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased. The cold was a little\r\ngreater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero. The fog was rising, and\r\nI hoped that that day our observations might be taken. Captain Nemo not\r\nhaving yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself to land. The soil\r\nwas still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere were traces of lava,\r\nscoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had vomited them I could not\r\nsee. Here, as lower down, this continent was alive with myriads of\r\nbirds. But their rule was now divided with large troops of sea-mammals,\r\nlooking at us with their soft eyes. There were several kinds of seals,\r\nsome stretched on the earth, some on flakes of ice, many going in and\r\nout of the sea. They did not flee at our approach, never having had\r\nanything to do with man; and I reckoned that there were provisions\r\nthere for hundreds of vessels.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Conseil, “will you tell me the names of these creatures?”\r\n\r\n“They are seals and morses.”\r\n\r\nIt was now eight in the morning. Four hours remained to us before the\r\nsun could be observed with advantage. I directed our steps towards a\r\nvast bay cut in the steep granite shore. There, I can aver that earth\r\nand ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,\r\nand I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd\r\nwho watched these immense flocks of Neptune. There were more seals than\r\nanything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the father\r\nwatching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones, some\r\nalready strong enough to go a few steps. When they wished to change\r\ntheir place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of their\r\nbodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin, which, as\r\nwith the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm. I should say\r\nthat, in the water, which is their element—the spine of these creatures\r\nis flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed feet—they swim\r\nadmirably. In resting on the earth they take the most graceful\r\nattitudes. Thus the ancients, observing their soft and expressive\r\nlooks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can\r\ngive, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming positions, and the\r\npoetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the male into a triton and\r\nthe female into a mermaid. I made Conseil notice the considerable\r\ndevelopment of the lobes of the brain in these interesting cetaceans.\r\nNo mammal, except man, has such a quantity of brain matter; they are\r\nalso capable of receiving a certain amount of education, are easily\r\ndomesticated, and I think, with other naturalists, that if properly\r\ntaught they would be of great service as fishing-dogs. The greater part\r\nof them slept on the rocks or on the sand. Amongst these seals,\r\nproperly so called, which have no external ears (in which they differ\r\nfrom the otter, whose ears are prominent), I noticed several varieties\r\nof seals about three yards long, with a white coat, bulldog heads,\r\narmed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at the top and four at the\r\nbottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape of a fleur-de-lis.\r\nAmongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal, with short, flexible\r\ntrunks. The giants of this species measured twenty feet round and ten\r\nyards and a half in length; but they did not move as we approached.\r\n\r\n“These creatures are not dangerous?” asked Conseil.\r\n\r\n“No; not unless you attack them. When they have to defend their young\r\ntheir rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the\r\nfishing-boats to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“They are quite right,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“I do not say they are not.”\r\n\r\nTwo miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters\r\nthe bay from the southerly winds. Beyond it we heard loud bellowings\r\nsuch as a troop of ruminants would produce.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Conseil; “a concert of bulls!”\r\n\r\n“No; a concert of morses.”\r\n\r\n“They are fighting!”\r\n\r\n“They are either fighting or playing.”\r\n\r\nWe now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and\r\nover stones which the ice made slippery. More than once I rolled over\r\nat the expense of my loins. Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did\r\nnot stumble, and helped me up, saying:\r\n\r\n“If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would\r\npreserve your equilibrium better.”\r\n\r\nArrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain\r\ncovered with morses. They were playing amongst themselves, and what we\r\nheard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.\r\n\r\nAs I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for\r\nthey did not move. Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish\r\ntint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant. Some of them\r\nwere four yards and a quarter long. Quieter and less timid than their\r\ncousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round\r\nthe outskirts of their encampment. After examining this city of morses,\r\nI began to think of returning. It was eleven o’clock, and, if Captain\r\nNemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished to be\r\npresent at the operation. We followed a narrow pathway running along\r\nthe summit of the steep shore. At half-past eleven we had reached the\r\nplace where we landed. The boat had run aground, bringing the Captain.\r\nI saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments near him, his\r\neyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun was then\r\ndescribing a lengthened curve. I took my place beside him, and waited\r\nwithout speaking. Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did not appear.\r\nIt was a fatality. Observations were still wanting. If not accomplished\r\nto-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any. We were indeed\r\nexactly at the 20th of March. To-morrow, the 21st, would be the\r\nequinox; the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six months, and\r\nwith its disappearance the long polar night would begin. Since the\r\nSeptember equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon, rising by\r\nlengthened spirals up to the 21st of December. At this period, the\r\nsummer solstice of the northern regions, it had begun to descend; and\r\nto-morrow was to shed its last rays upon them. I communicated my fears\r\nand observations to Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“You are right, M. Aronnax,” said he; “if to-morrow I cannot take the\r\naltitude of the sun, I shall not be able to do it for six months. But\r\nprecisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of\r\nMarch, my bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see the\r\nsun.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“Because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it\r\nis difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon, and grave\r\nerrors may be made with instruments.”\r\n\r\n“What will you do then?”\r\n\r\n“I shall only use my chronometer,” replied Captain Nemo. “If to-morrow,\r\nthe 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for refraction, is\r\nexactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I am at the\r\nSouth Pole.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said I. “But this statement is not mathematically correct,\r\nbecause the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do\r\nnot want more. Till to-morrow, then!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo returned on board. Conseil and I remained to survey the\r\nshore, observing and studying until five o’clock. Then I went to bed,\r\nnot, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the\r\nradiant orb. The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning, I\r\nmounted the platform. I found Captain Nemo there.\r\n\r\n“The weather is lightening a little,” said he. “I have some hope. After\r\nbreakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation.”\r\n\r\nThat point settled, I sought Ned Land. I wanted to take him with me.\r\nBut the obstinate Canadian refused, and I saw that his taciturnity and\r\nhis bad humour grew day by day. After all, I was not sorry for his\r\nobstinacy under the circumstances. Indeed, there were too many seals on\r\nshore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting\r\nfisherman’s way. Breakfast over, we went on shore. The _Nautilus_ had\r\ngone some miles further up in the night. It was a whole league from the\r\ncoast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high.\r\nThe boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the\r\ninstruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a\r\nbarometer. While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the three\r\nkinds peculiar to the southern seas; the whale, or the English “right\r\nwhale,” which has no dorsal fin; the “humpback,” with reeved chest and\r\nlarge, whitish fins, which, in spite of its name, do not form wings;\r\nand the fin-back, of a yellowish brown, the liveliest of all the\r\ncetacea. This powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws\r\nto a great height columns of air and vapour, which look like whirlwinds\r\nof smoke. These different mammals were disporting themselves in troops\r\nin the quiet waters; and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic\r\nPole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by\r\nthe hunters. I also noticed large medusæ floating between the reeds.\r\n\r\nAt nine we landed; the sky was brightening, the clouds were flying to\r\nthe south, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the\r\nwaters. Captain Nemo went towards the peak, which he doubtless meant to\r\nbe his observatory. It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and the\r\npumice-stones, in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous\r\nsmell from the smoking cracks. For a man unaccustomed to walk on land,\r\nthe Captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility I never saw\r\nequalled and which a hunter would have envied. We were two hours\r\ngetting to the summit of this peak, which was half porphyry and half\r\nbasalt. From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, towards the north,\r\ndistinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky. At our feet lay\r\nfields of dazzling whiteness. Over our heads a pale azure, free from\r\nfog. To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire,\r\nalready horned by the cutting of the horizon. From the bosom of the\r\nwater rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds. In the distance lay the\r\n_Nautilus_ like a cetacean asleep on the water. Behind us, to the south\r\nand east, an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, the\r\nlimits of which were not visible. On arriving at the summit Captain\r\nNemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer, for he would have\r\nto consider that in taking his observations. At a quarter to twelve the\r\nsun, then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc shedding\r\nits last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had\r\nyet ploughed. Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular glass which, by\r\nmeans of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched the orb sinking\r\nbelow the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened diagonal. I held\r\nthe chronometer. My heart beat fast. If the disappearance of the\r\nhalf-disc of the sun coincided with twelve o’clock on the chronometer,\r\nwe were at the pole itself.\r\n\r\n“Twelve!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“The South Pole!” replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing me\r\nthe glass, which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nI looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the shadows mounting\r\nby degrees up its slopes. At that moment Captain Nemo, resting with his\r\nhand on my shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n“I, Captain Nemo, on this 21st day of March, 1868, have reached the\r\nSouth Pole on the ninetieth degree; and I take possession of this part\r\nof the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents.”\r\n\r\n“In whose name, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“In my own, sir!”\r\n\r\nSaying which, Captain Nemo unfurled a black banner, bearing an “N” in\r\ngold quartered on its bunting. Then, turning towards the orb of day,\r\nwhose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Adieu, sun! Disappear, thou radiant orb! rest beneath this open sea,\r\nand let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains!”"

    "text": "CHAPTER XV\r\nACCIDENT OR INCIDENT?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations\r\nfor departure were begun. The last gleams of twilight were melting into\r\nnight. The cold was great, the constellations shone with wonderful\r\nintensity. In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern Cross—the\r\npolar bear of Antarctic regions. The thermometer showed 12 below zero,\r\nand when the wind freshened it was most biting. Flakes of ice increased\r\non the open water. The sea seemed everywhere alike. Numerous blackish\r\npatches spread on the surface, showing the formation of fresh ice.\r\nEvidently the southern basin, frozen during the six winter months, was\r\nabsolutely inaccessible. What became of the whales in that time?\r\nDoubtless they went beneath the icebergs, seeking more practicable\r\nseas. As to the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a hard climate,\r\nthey remained on these icy shores. These creatures have the instinct to\r\nbreak holes in the ice-field and to keep them open. To these holes they\r\ncome for breath; when the birds, driven away by the cold, have\r\nemigrated to the north, these sea mammals remain sole masters of the\r\npolar continent. But the reservoirs were filling with water, and the\r\n_Nautilus_ was slowly descending. At 1,000 feet deep it stopped; its\r\nscrew beat the waves, and it advanced straight towards the north at a\r\nspeed of fifteen miles an hour. Towards night it was already floating\r\nunder the immense body of the iceberg. At three in the morning I was\r\nawakened by a violent shock. I sat up in my bed and listened in the\r\ndarkness, when I was thrown into the middle of the room. The\r\n_Nautilus_, after having struck, had rebounded violently. I groped\r\nalong the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which was lit\r\nby the luminous ceiling. The furniture was upset. Fortunately the\r\nwindows were firmly set, and had held fast. The pictures on the\r\nstarboard side, from being no longer vertical, were clinging to the\r\npaper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from\r\nthe wall. The _Nautilus_ was lying on its starboard side perfectly\r\nmotionless. I heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain\r\nNemo did not appear. As I was leaving the saloon, Ned Land and Conseil\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said I, at once.\r\n\r\n“I came to ask you, sir,” replied Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” exclaimed the Canadian, “I know well enough! The\r\n_Nautilus_ has struck; and, judging by the way she lies, I do not think\r\nshe will right herself as she did the first time in Torres Straits.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I asked, “has she at least come to the surface of the sea?”\r\n\r\n“We do not know,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“It is easy to decide,” I answered. I consulted the manometer. To my\r\ngreat surprise, it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms. “What does\r\nthat mean?” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“We must ask Captain Nemo,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“But where shall we find him?” said Ned Land.\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” said I, to my companions.\r\n\r\nWe left the saloon. There was no one in the library. At the centre\r\nstaircase, by the berths of the ship’s crew, there was no one. I\r\nthought that Captain Nemo must be in the pilot’s cage. It was best to\r\nwait. We all returned to the saloon. For twenty minutes we remained\r\nthus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board\r\nthe _Nautilus_, when Captain Nemo entered. He seemed not to see us; his\r\nface, generally so impassive, showed signs of uneasiness. He watched\r\nthe compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to the\r\nplanisphere, placed his finger on a spot representing the southern\r\nseas. I would not interrupt him; but, some minutes later, when he\r\nturned towards me, I said, using one of his own expressions in the\r\nTorres Straits:\r\n\r\n“An incident, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; an accident this time.”\r\n\r\n“Serious?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Is the danger immediate?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The _Nautilus_ has stranded?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And this has happened—how?”\r\n\r\n“From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man. Not a mistake\r\nhas been made in the working. But we cannot prevent equilibrium from\r\nproducing its effects. We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist\r\nnatural ones.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this\r\nphilosophical reflection. On the whole, his answer helped me little.\r\n\r\n“May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?”\r\n\r\n“An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has turned over,” he\r\nreplied. “When icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water or\r\nreiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises, and the whole thing\r\nturns over. This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it fell,\r\nstruck the _Nautilus_, then, gliding under its hull, raised it with\r\nirresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, where\r\nit is lying on its side.”\r\n\r\n“But can we not get the _Nautilus_ off by emptying its reservoirs, that\r\nit might regain its equilibrium?”\r\n\r\n“That, sir, is being done at this moment. You can hear the pump\r\nworking. Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the\r\n_Nautilus_ is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,\r\nuntil some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot be\r\naltered.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the _Nautilus_ still held the same position to starboard;\r\ndoubtless it would right itself when the block stopped. But at this\r\nmoment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two\r\nglassy surfaces? I reflected on all the consequences of our position.\r\nCaptain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer. Since the fall of\r\nthe iceberg, the _Nautilus_ had risen about a hundred and fifty feet,\r\nbut it still made the same angle with the perpendicular. Suddenly a\r\nslight movement was felt in the hold. Evidently it was righting a\r\nlittle. Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their\r\nnormal position. The partitions were nearing the upright. No one spoke.\r\nWith beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening. The boards\r\nbecame horizontal under our feet. Ten minutes passed.\r\n\r\n“At last we have righted!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon.\r\n\r\n“But are we floating?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he replied; “since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when\r\nempty, the _Nautilus_ must rise to the surface of the sea.”\r\n\r\nWe were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either\r\nside of the _Nautilus_, rose a dazzling wall of ice. Above and beneath\r\nthe same wall. Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg\r\nstretched over us like an immense ceiling. Beneath, because the\r\noverturned block, having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on\r\nthe lateral walls, which kept it in that position. The _Nautilus_ was\r\nreally imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in\r\nbreadth, filled with quiet water. It was easy to get out of it by going\r\neither forward or backward, and then make a free passage under the\r\niceberg, some hundreds of yards deeper. The luminous ceiling had been\r\nextinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense light.\r\nIt was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently\r\nback to the sheets of the lantern. I cannot describe the effect of the\r\nvoltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut; upon every\r\nangle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different light, according\r\nto the nature of the veins running through the ice; a dazzling mine of\r\ngems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays crossing with the\r\ngreen of the emerald. Here and there were opal shades of wonderful\r\nsoftness, running through bright spots like diamonds of fire, the\r\nbrilliancy of which the eye could not bear. The power of the lantern\r\nseemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp through the lenticular\r\nplates of a first-class lighthouse.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful! how beautiful!” cried Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “it is a wonderful sight. Is it not, Ned?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, confound it! Yes,” answered Ned Land, “it is superb! I am mad at\r\nbeing obliged to admit it. No one has ever seen anything like it; but\r\nthe sight may cost us dear. And, if I must say all, I think we are\r\nseeing here things which God never intended man to see.”\r\n\r\nNed was right, it was too beautiful. Suddenly a cry from Conseil made\r\nme turn.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Shut your eyes, sir! Do not look, sir!” Saying which, Conseil clapped\r\nhis hands over his eyes.\r\n\r\n“But what is the matter, my boy?”\r\n\r\n“I am dazzled, blinded.”\r\n\r\nMy eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand\r\nthe fire which seemed to devour them. I understood what had happened.\r\nThe _Nautilus_ had put on full speed. All the quiet lustre of the\r\nice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning. The fire from\r\nthese myriads of diamonds was blinding. It required some time to calm\r\nour troubled looks. At last the hands were taken down.\r\n\r\n“Faith, I should never have believed it,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\nIt was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at\r\nthe bows of the _Nautilus_. I knew that its spur had struck a block of\r\nice. It must have been a false manœuvre, for this submarine tunnel,\r\nobstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation. I thought that\r\nCaptain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles\r\nor else follow the windings of the tunnel. In any case, the road before\r\nus could not be entirely blocked. But, contrary to my expectations, the\r\n_Nautilus_ took a decided retrograde motion.\r\n\r\n“We are going backwards?” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied. “This end of the tunnel can have no egress.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said I, “the working is easy. We must go back again, and go out\r\nat the southern opening. That is all.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.\r\nBut the retrograde motion of the _Nautilus_ was increasing; and,\r\nreversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.\r\n\r\n“It will be a hindrance,” said Ned.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at\r\nlast?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” repeated Ned Land, “provided we do get out at last!”\r\n\r\nFor a short time I walked from the saloon to the library. My companions\r\nwere silent. I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a book, which\r\nmy eyes overran mechanically. A quarter of an hour after, Conseil,\r\napproaching me, said, “Is what you are reading very interesting, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Very interesting!” I replied.\r\n\r\n“I should think so, sir. It is your own book you are reading.”\r\n\r\n“My book?”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine\r\nDepths. I did not even dream of it. I closed the book and returned to\r\nmy walk. Ned and Conseil rose to go.\r\n\r\n“Stay here, my friends,” said I, detaining them. “Let us remain\r\ntogether until we are out of this block.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, sir,” Conseil replied.\r\n\r\nSome hours passed. I often looked at the instruments hanging from the\r\npartition. The manometer showed that the _Nautilus_ kept at a constant\r\ndepth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to\r\nsouth; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in\r\nsuch a cramped space, was very great. But Captain Nemo knew that he\r\ncould not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us. At\r\ntwenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time\r\nfrom behind. I turned pale. My companions were close by my side. I\r\nseized Conseil’s hand. Our looks expressed our feelings better than\r\nwords. At this moment the Captain entered the saloon. I went up to him.\r\n\r\n“Our course is barred southward?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet.”\r\n\r\n“We are blocked up then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”"

    "title": "CHAPTER XVI. WANT OF AIR",
    "text": "CHAPTER XVI\r\nWANT OF AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nThus around the _Nautilus_, above and below, was an impenetrable wall\r\nof ice. We were prisoners to the iceberg. I watched the Captain. His\r\ncountenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said calmly, “there are two ways of dying in the\r\ncircumstances in which we are placed.” (This puzzling person had the\r\nair of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) “The first is\r\nto be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation. I do not speak of\r\nthe possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the\r\n_Nautilus_ will certainly last longer than we shall. Let us, then,\r\ncalculate our chances.”\r\n\r\n“As to suffocation, Captain,” I replied, “that is not to be feared,\r\nbecause our reservoirs are full.”\r\n\r\n“Just so; but they will only yield two days’ supply of air. Now, for\r\nthirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the\r\nheavy atmosphere of the _Nautilus_ requires renewal. In forty-eight\r\nhours our reserve will be exhausted.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?”\r\n\r\n“We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us.”\r\n\r\n“On which side?”\r\n\r\n“Sound will tell us. I am going to run the _Nautilus_ aground on the\r\nlower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is\r\nleast thick.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo went out. Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the\r\nwater was entering the reservoirs. The _Nautilus_ sank slowly, and\r\nrested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower\r\nbank was immersed.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” I said, “our situation is serious, but I rely on your\r\ncourage and energy.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the Canadian, “I am ready to do anything for the general\r\nsafety.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Ned,” and I held out my hand to the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“I will add,” he continued, “that, being as handy with the pickaxe as\r\nwith the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my\r\nservices.”\r\n\r\n“He will not refuse your help. Come, Ned!”\r\n\r\nI led him to the room where the crew of the _Nautilus_ were putting on\r\ntheir cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned’s proposal, which he\r\naccepted. The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon as\r\nhis companions. When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the drawing-room,\r\nwhere the panes of glass were open, and, posted near Conseil, I\r\nexamined the ambient beds that supported the _Nautilus_. Some instants\r\nafter, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice, and\r\namong them Ned Land, easily known by his stature. Captain Nemo was with\r\nthem. Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings, to be\r\nsure of working in the right direction. Long sounding lines were sunk\r\nin the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped by\r\nthe thick wall. It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like\r\nsurface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in\r\nheight. Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface. There ten yards of\r\nwall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the\r\nice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in\r\nextent to the waterline of the _Nautilus_. There were about 6,000 cubic\r\nyards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the\r\nice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with\r\nindefatigable energy. Instead of digging round the _Nautilus_ which\r\nwould have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense\r\ntrench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to\r\nwork simultaneously with their screws on several points of its\r\ncircumference. Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter\r\nvigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass. By a curious\r\neffect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so\r\nto speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at\r\nthe top in proportion as it diminished at the base. But that mattered\r\nlittle, so long as the lower part grew thinner. After two hours’ hard\r\nwork, Ned Land came in exhausted. He and his comrades were replaced by\r\nnew workers, whom Conseil and I joined. The second lieutenant of the\r\n_Nautilus_ superintended us. The water seemed singularly cold, but I\r\nsoon got warm handling the pickaxe. My movements were free enough,\r\nalthough they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres. When I\r\nre-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I\r\nfound a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the\r\nRouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the _Nautilus_,\r\nalready charged with carbonic acid. The air had not been renewed for\r\nforty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably\r\nenfeebled. However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised a\r\nblock of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about 600\r\ncubic yards! Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish this\r\nmuch it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise\r\nto a satisfactory conclusion. Five nights and four days! And we have\r\nonly air enough for two days in the reservoirs! “Without taking into\r\naccount,” said Ned, “that, even if we get out of this infernal prison,\r\nwe shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut out from all\r\npossible communication with the atmosphere.” True enough! Who could\r\nthen foresee the minimum of time necessary for our deliverance? We\r\nmight be suffocated before the _Nautilus_ could regain the surface of\r\nthe waves? Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb, with all those\r\nit enclosed? The situation was terrible. But everyone had looked the\r\ndanger in the face, and each was determined to do his duty to the last.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried\r\naway, and still further sank the immense hollow. But in the morning\r\nwhen, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a\r\ntemperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the\r\nside walls were gradually closing in. The beds of water farthest from\r\nthe trench, that were not warmed by the men’s work, showed a tendency\r\nto solidification. In presence of this new and imminent danger, what\r\nwould become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the\r\nsolidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions\r\nof the _Nautilus_ like glass?\r\n\r\nI did not tell my companions of this new danger. What was the good of\r\ndamping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape? But\r\nwhen I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave\r\ncomplication.\r\n\r\n“I know it,” he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most\r\nterrible apprehensions. “It is one danger more; but I see no way of\r\nescaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than\r\nsolidification. We must be beforehand with it, that is all.”\r\n\r\nOn this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously. The work\r\nkept me up. Besides, to work was to quit the _Nautilus_, and breathe\r\ndirectly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our\r\napparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.\r\nTowards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper. When I returned on\r\nboard, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air\r\nwas filled—ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this\r\ndeleterious gas. We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a\r\nconsiderable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it\r\nwould restore the vivifying fluid. I had thought well over it; but of\r\nwhat good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration\r\nhad invaded every part of the vessel? To absorb it, it was necessary to\r\nfill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly. Now\r\nthis substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it. On\r\nthat evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,\r\nand let some pure air into the interior of the _Nautilus;_ without this\r\nprecaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation. The next\r\nday, March 26th, I resumed my miner’s work in beginning the fifth yard.\r\nThe side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.\r\nIt was evident that they would meet before the _Nautilus_ was able to\r\ndisengage itself. Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly\r\nfell from my hands. What was the good of digging if I must be\r\nsuffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?—a\r\npunishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have\r\ninvented! Just then Captain Nemo passed near me. I touched his hand and\r\nshowed him the walls of our prison. The wall to port had advanced to at\r\nleast four yards from the hull of the _Nautilus_. The Captain\r\nunderstood me, and signed me to follow him. We went on board. I took\r\noff my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be\r\nsealed up in this solidified water as in cement.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but what is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! if my _Nautilus_ were strong enough to bear this pressure without\r\nbeing crushed!”\r\n\r\n“Well?” I asked, not catching the Captain’s idea.\r\n\r\n“Do you not understand,” he replied, “that this congelation of water\r\nwill help us? Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst\r\nthrough this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it\r\nbursts the hardest stones? Do you not perceive that it would be an\r\nagent of safety instead of destruction?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Captain, perhaps. But, whatever resistance to crushing the\r\n_Nautilus_ possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and\r\nwould be flattened like an iron plate.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, sir. Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature, but\r\non our own exertions. We must stop this solidification. Not only will\r\nthe side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of water\r\nbefore or behind the _Nautilus_. The congelation gains on us on all\r\nsides.”\r\n\r\n“How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on\r\nboard?”\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked in my face. “After to-morrow they will be empty!”\r\n\r\nA cold sweat came over me. However, ought I to have been astonished at\r\nthe answer? On March 22, the _Nautilus_ was in the open polar seas. We\r\nwere at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board. And\r\nwhat was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers. Even\r\nnow, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an involuntary\r\nterror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air. Meanwhile,\r\nCaptain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had struck him;\r\nbut he seemed to reject it. At last, these words escaped his lips:\r\n\r\n“Boiling water!” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Boiling water?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.\r\nWould not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,\r\nraise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?”\r\n\r\n“Let us try it,” I said resolutely.\r\n\r\n“Let us try it, Professor.”\r\n\r\nThe thermometer then stood at 7° outside. Captain Nemo took me to the\r\ngalleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished the\r\ndrinkable water by evaporation. They filled these with water, and all\r\nthe electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in\r\nthe liquid. In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It was directed\r\ntowards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in proportion. The\r\nheat developed by the troughs was such that cold water, drawn up from\r\nthe sea after only having gone through the machines, came boiling into\r\nthe body of the pump. The injection was begun, and three hours after\r\nthe thermometer marked 6° below zero outside. One degree was gained.\r\nTwo hours later the thermometer only marked 4°.\r\n\r\n“We shall succeed,” I said to the Captain, after having anxiously\r\nwatched the result of the operation.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he answered, “that we shall not be crushed. We have no more\r\nsuffocation to fear.”\r\n\r\nDuring the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below zero.\r\nThe injections could not carry it to a higher point. But, as the\r\ncongelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at least\r\nreassured against the dangers of solidification.\r\n\r\nThe next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve\r\nfeet only remaining to be cleared away. There was yet forty-eight\r\nhours’ work. The air could not be renewed in the interior of the\r\n_Nautilus_. And this day would make it worse. An intolerable weight\r\noppressed me. Towards three o’clock in the evening this feeling rose to\r\na violent degree. Yawns dislocated my jaws. My lungs panted as they\r\ninhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more. A\r\nmoral torpor took hold of me. I was powerless, almost unconscious. My\r\nbrave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in the\r\nsame manner, never left me. He took my hand and encouraged me, and I\r\nheard him murmur, “Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave more\r\nair for my master!”\r\n\r\nTears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus. If our situation to\r\nall was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would\r\nwe put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn! Pickaxes sounded on the\r\nfrozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands. But\r\nwhat were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter? Vital air came to\r\nthe lungs! We breathed! we breathed!\r\n\r\nAll this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed\r\ntime. His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting\r\ncompanions the apparatus that supplied him with life. Captain Nemo set\r\nthe example, and submitted first to this severe discipline. When the\r\ntime came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the\r\nvitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.\r\n\r\nOn that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.\r\nOnly two yards remained to be raised from the surface. Two yards only\r\nseparated us from the open sea. But the reservoirs were nearly emptied\r\nof air. The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not\r\na particle for the _Nautilus_. When I went back on board, I was half\r\nsuffocated. What a night! I know not how to describe it. The next day\r\nmy breathing was oppressed. Dizziness accompanied the pain in my head\r\nand made me like a drunken man. My companions showed the same symptoms.\r\nSome of the crew had rattling in the throat.\r\n\r\nOn that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the\r\npickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still\r\nseparated us from the liquid sheet. This man’s coolness and energy\r\nnever forsook him. He subdued his physical pains by moral force.\r\n\r\nBy his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the\r\nice-bed by a change of specific gravity. When it floated they towed it\r\nso as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the\r\nwater-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and\r\nshut himself up in the hole.\r\n\r\nJust then all the crew came on board, and the double door of\r\ncommunication was shut. The _Nautilus_ then rested on the bed of ice,\r\nwhich was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had\r\nperforated in a thousand places. The taps of the reservoirs were then\r\nopened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the\r\nweight of the _Nautilus_ to 1,800 tons. We waited, we listened,\r\nforgetting our sufferings in hope. Our safety depended on this last\r\nchance. Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the\r\nhumming sound under the hull of the _Nautilus_. The ice cracked with a\r\nsingular noise, like tearing paper, and the _Nautilus_ sank.\r\n\r\n“We are off!” murmured Conseil in my ear.\r\n\r\nI could not answer him. I seized his hand, and pressed it convulsively.\r\nAll at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge, the _Nautilus_\r\nsank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it fell as if it\r\nwas in a vacuum. Then all the electric force was put on the pumps, that\r\nsoon began to let the water out of the reservoirs. After some minutes,\r\nour fall was stopped. Soon, too, the manometer indicated an ascending\r\nmovement. The screw, going at full speed, made the iron hull tremble to\r\nits very bolts and drew us towards the north. But if this floating\r\nunder the iceberg is to last another day before we reach the open sea,\r\nI shall be dead first.\r\n\r\nHalf stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating. My face\r\nwas purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended. I neither saw nor\r\nheard. All notion of time had gone from my mind. My muscles could not\r\ncontract. I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was conscious\r\nof the agony that was coming over me. I felt as if I was going to die.\r\nSuddenly I came to. Some breaths of air penetrated my lungs. Had we\r\nrisen to the surface of the waves? Were we free of the iceberg? No! Ned\r\nand Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing themselves to save\r\nme. Some particles of air still remained at the bottom of one\r\napparatus. Instead of using it, they had kept it for me, and, while\r\nthey were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop. I wanted\r\nto push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some moments I\r\nbreathed freely. I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the morning.\r\nIt ought to be the 28th of March. The _Nautilus_ went at a frightful\r\npace, forty miles an hour. It literally tore through the water. Where\r\nwas Captain Nemo? Had he succumbed? Were his companions dead with him?\r\nAt the moment the manometer indicated that we were not more than twenty\r\nfeet from the surface. A mere plate of ice separated us from the\r\natmosphere. Could we not break it? Perhaps. In any case the _Nautilus_\r\nwas going to attempt it. I felt that it was in an oblique position,\r\nlowering the stern, and raising the bows. The introduction of water had\r\nbeen the means of disturbing its equilibrium. Then, impelled by its\r\npowerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath like a\r\nformidable battering-ram. It broke it by backing and then rushing\r\nforward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at last,\r\ndashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that\r\ncrushed beneath its weight. The panel was opened—one might say torn\r\noff—and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the\r\n_Nautilus_."

    "text": "CHAPTER XVII\r\nFROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had\r\ncarried me there. But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air. My\r\ntwo companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles. The other\r\nunhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with\r\nimpunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them. We, on\r\nthe contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air\r\nfreely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that\r\nfilled us with this keen enjoyment.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Conseil, “how delightful this oxygen is! Master need not\r\nfear to breathe it. There is enough for everybody.”\r\n\r\nNed Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten\r\na shark. Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I saw\r\nwe were alone on the platform. The foreign seamen in the _Nautilus_\r\nwere contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of\r\nthem had come to drink in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my\r\ntwo companions. Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last\r\nhours of this long agony. All my gratitude could not repay such\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said I, “we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am\r\nunder infinite obligations to you.”\r\n\r\n“Which I shall take advantage of,” exclaimed the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal\r\n_Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Conseil, “after all this, are we going right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “for we are going the way of the sun, and here the\r\nsun is in the north.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Ned Land; “but it remains to be seen whether he will\r\nbring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into\r\nfrequented or deserted seas.”\r\n\r\nI could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would\r\nrather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and\r\nAmerica at the same time. He would thus complete the tour round the\r\nsubmarine world, and return to those waters in which the _Nautilus_\r\ncould sail freely. We ought, before long, to settle this important\r\npoint. The _Nautilus_ went at a rapid pace. The polar circle was soon\r\npassed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. We were off the American\r\npoint, March 31st, at seven o’clock in the evening. Then all our past\r\nsufferings were forgotten. The remembrance of that imprisonment in the\r\nice was effaced from our minds. We only thought of the future. Captain\r\nNemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the\r\nplatform. The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by\r\nthe lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the _Nautilus_. Now,\r\non that evening, it was evident, to my great satisfaction, that we\r\nwere going back to the North by the Atlantic. The next day, April 1st,\r\nwhen the _Nautilus_ ascended to the surface some minutes before noon,\r\nwe sighted land to the west. It was Terra del Fuego, which the first\r\nnavigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from\r\nthe natives’ huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance rose\r\nhigh mountains. I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that\r\nrises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a very pointed\r\nsummit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or\r\nof wet weather. At this moment the peak was clearly defined against the\r\nsky. The _Nautilus_, diving again under the water, approached the\r\ncoast, which was only some few miles off. From the glass windows in the\r\ndrawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech, of\r\nwhich the open polar sea contains so many specimens, with their sharp\r\npolished filaments; they measured about 300 yards in length—real\r\ncables, thicker than one’s thumb; and, having great tenacity, they are\r\noften used as ropes for vessels. Another weed known as velp, with\r\nleaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions, hung at the\r\nbottom. It served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and\r\nmolluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish. There seals and otters had splendid\r\nrepasts, eating the flesh of fish with sea-vegetables, according to the\r\nEnglish fashion. Over this fertile and luxuriant ground the _Nautilus_\r\npassed with great rapidity. Towards evening it approached the Falkland\r\ngroup, the rough summits of which I recognised the following day. The\r\ndepth of the sea was moderate. On the shores our nets brought in\r\nbeautiful specimens of sea weed, and particularly a certain fucus, the\r\nroots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world. Geese\r\nand ducks fell by dozens on the platform, and soon took their places in\r\nthe pantry on board.\r\n\r\nWhen the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the\r\nhorizon, the _Nautilus_ sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards,\r\nand followed the American coast. Captain Nemo did not show himself.\r\nUntil the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia,\r\nsometimes under the ocean, sometimes at the surface. The _Nautilus_\r\npassed beyond the large estuary formed by the Plata, and was, on\r\nthe 4th of April, fifty-six miles off Uraguay. Its direction was\r\nnorthwards, and followed the long windings of the coast of South\r\nAmerica. We had then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas\r\nof Japan. About eleven o’clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn\r\nwas crossed on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio\r\nstanding out to sea. Captain Nemo, to Ned Land’s great displeasure,\r\ndid not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for\r\nwe went at a giddy speed. Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind\r\ncould follow us, and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThis speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th\r\nof April we sighted the most easterly point of South America that forms\r\nCape San Roque. But then the _Nautilus_ swerved again, and sought the\r\nlowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and\r\nSierra Leone on the African coast. This valley bifurcates to the\r\nparallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the north by the enormous\r\ndepression of 9,000 yards. In this place, the geological basin of the\r\nocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff of three and a half\r\nmiles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, another wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all\r\nthe sunk continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of this immense valley\r\nis dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a\r\npicturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that\r\nwere in the library of the _Nautilus_—charts evidently due to Captain\r\nNemo’s hand, and made after his personal observations. For two days the\r\ndesert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes.\r\nThe _Nautilus_ was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which\r\ncarried it to all elevations. But on the 11th of April it rose\r\nsuddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast\r\nestuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens\r\nthe sea-water for the distance of several leagues.\r\n\r\nThe equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a\r\nFrench territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a\r\nstiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed\r\na single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he\r\nspoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his\r\nschemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that\r\nmust inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting\r\nstudies. During the days of April 11th and 12th, the _Nautilus_ did not\r\nleave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul\r\nof zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by\r\nthe chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful\r\nphyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other\r\nspecies the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,\r\nwith a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented with vertical lines,\r\nspeckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.\r\nAs to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already\r\nobserved—turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines intercrossed,\r\nwith red spots standing out plainly against the flesh; odd pteroceras,\r\nlike petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas, argonauts, cuttle-fish\r\n(excellent eating), and certain species of calmars that naturalists of\r\nantiquity have classed amongst the flying-fish, and that serve\r\nprincipally for bait for cod-fishing. I had now an opportunity of\r\nstudying several species of fish on these shores. Amongst the\r\ncartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel, fifteen inches\r\nlong, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back, brown belly,\r\nsilvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye encircled\r\nwith gold—a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon had drawn to\r\nthe sea, for they inhabit fresh waters—tuberculated streaks, with\r\npointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long jagged sting;\r\nlittle sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and several rows of\r\nteeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name of pantouffles;\r\nvespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a yard long, to\r\nwhich pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that make them\r\nlook like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near the\r\nnostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some species\r\nof balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant gold\r\ncolour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades like\r\na pigeon’s throat.\r\n\r\nI end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very\r\nexact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging\r\nto the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a\r\nbeautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;\r\nodontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering\r\nwith a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two\r\nanal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with\r\ntorches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and\r\nfirm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like\r\nsmoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom\r\nof the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver\r\nblend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed\r\nspares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose\r\nphosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;\r\norange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal\r\nfins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this “et cetera,” I must not omit to mention fish that\r\nConseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had\r\nhauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,\r\nformed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white\r\nunderneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled\r\nwith black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on\r\nthe platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive\r\nmovements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent\r\nit into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to\r\nit, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In\r\na moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body\r\nparalysed, crying—\r\n\r\n“Oh! master, master! help me!”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly.\r\nThe Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till\r\nhe became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish\r\nof the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium\r\nconductor like water, strikes fish at several yards’ distance, so\r\ngreat is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces\r\nof which do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next\r\nday, April 12th, the _Nautilus_ approached the Dutch coast, near the\r\nmouth of the Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together;\r\nthey were manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to\r\nthe sirenian order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive,\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen\r\nhundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had\r\nassigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the\r\nseals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus\r\ndestroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.\r\n\r\n“And do you know,” I added, “what has been the result since men have\r\nalmost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds\r\nhave poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,\r\nthat desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are\r\nmultiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly\r\ndeveloped from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are\r\nto believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the\r\nseas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,\r\nmedusæ, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of\r\ninfection, since their waves would not possess ‘these vast stomachs\r\nthat God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.’”"

    "title": "CHAPTER XVIII. THE POULPS",
    "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\r\nTHE POULPS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several days the _Nautilus_ kept off from the American coast.\r\nEvidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of\r\nthe sea of the Antilles. April 16th, we sighted Martinique and\r\nGuadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles. I saw their tall\r\npeaks for an instant. The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his\r\nprojects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous\r\nboats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.\r\nFlight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to\r\ntake possession of the boat without the Captain’s knowledge. But in the\r\nopen sea it could not be thought of. The Canadian, Conseil, and I had a\r\nlong conversation on this subject. For six months we had been prisoners\r\non board the _Nautilus_. We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and, as Ned\r\nLand said, there was no reason why it should come to an end. We could\r\nhope nothing from the Captain of the _Nautilus_, but only from\r\nourselves. Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more\r\nretired, less sociable. He seemed to shun me. I met him rarely.\r\nFormerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he\r\nleft me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon. What change had\r\ncome over him? For what cause? For my part, I did not wish to bury with\r\nme my curious and novel studies. I had now the power to write the true\r\nbook of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see\r\ndaylight. The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas. There\r\nrose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds. It was about\r\neleven o’clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable\r\npricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of\r\nlarge seaweeds.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not\r\nbe astonished to see some of these monsters.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod\r\nclass?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “poulps of huge dimensions.”\r\n\r\n“I will never believe that such animals exist,” said Ned.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, “I\r\nremember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by\r\nan octopus’s arm.”\r\n\r\n“You saw that?” said the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ned.”\r\n\r\n“With your own eyes?”\r\n\r\n“With my own eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Where, pray, might that be?”\r\n\r\n“At St. Malo,” answered Conseil.\r\n\r\n“In the port?” said Ned, ironically.\r\n\r\n“No; in a church,” replied Conseil.\r\n\r\n“In a church!” cried the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Yes; friend Ned. In a picture representing the poulp in question.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.\r\n\r\n“He is quite right,” I said. “I have heard of this picture; but the\r\nsubject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think\r\nof legends in the matter of natural history. Besides, when it is a\r\nquestion of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild. Not only is\r\nit supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain\r\nOlaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an\r\nisland than an animal. It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was\r\nbuilding an altar on an immense rock. Mass finished, the rock began to\r\nwalk, and returned to the sea. The rock was a poulp. Another Bishop,\r\nPontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry\r\ncould manœuvre. Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters whose\r\nmouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar.”\r\n\r\n“But how much is true of these stories?” asked Conseil.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth\r\nto get to fable or legend. Nevertheless, there must be some ground for\r\nthe imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and\r\ncuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the\r\ncetaceans. Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five\r\ncubits, or nine feet two inches. Our fishermen frequently see some that\r\nare more than four feet long. Some skeletons of poulps are preserved in\r\nthe museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two yards in\r\nlength. Besides, according to the calculations of some naturalists, one\r\nof these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twenty-seven\r\nfeet long. That would suffice to make a formidable monster.”\r\n\r\n“Do they fish for them in these days?” asked Ned.\r\n\r\n“If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least. One of my\r\nfriends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one\r\nof these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas. But the\r\nmost astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the\r\nexistence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861.”\r\n\r\n“What is the fact?” asked Ned Land.\r\n\r\n“This is it. In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in\r\nthe same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector\r\nperceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters. Captain\r\nBouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,\r\nwithout much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft\r\nflesh. After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a\r\nslip-knot round the body of the mollusc. The noose slipped as far as\r\nthe tail fins and there stopped. They tried then to haul it on board,\r\nbut its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord\r\nseparated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he\r\ndisappeared under the water.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! is that a fact?”\r\n\r\n“An indisputable fact, my good Ned. They proposed to name this poulp\r\n‘Bouguer’s cuttlefish.’”\r\n\r\n“What length was it?” asked the Canadian.\r\n\r\n“Did it not measure about six yards?” said Conseil, who, posted at the\r\nwindow, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Its head,” rejoined Conseil, “was it not crowned with eight tentacles,\r\nthat beat the water like a nest of serpents?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable\r\ndevelopment?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Conseil.”\r\n\r\n“And was not its mouth like a parrot’s beak?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, Conseil.”\r\n\r\n“Very well! no offence to master,” he replied, quietly; “if this is not\r\nBouguer’s cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Conseil. Ned Land hurried to the window.\r\n\r\n“What a horrible beast!” he cried.\r\n\r\nI looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust. Before\r\nmy eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the\r\nmarvellous. It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards long. It\r\nswam crossways in the direction of the _Nautilus_ with great speed,\r\nwatching us with its enormous staring green eyes. Its eight arms, or\r\nrather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of cephalopod\r\nto these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were twisted like\r\nthe furies’ hair. One could see the 250 air holes on the inner side of\r\nthe tentacles. The monster’s mouth, a horned beak like a parrot’s,\r\nopened and shut vertically. Its tongue, a horned substance, furnished\r\nwith several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from this\r\nveritable pair of shears. What a freak of nature, a bird’s beak on a\r\nmollusc! Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might weigh\r\n4,000 to 5,000 lbs.; the, varying colour changing with great rapidity,\r\naccording to the irritation of the animal, passed successively from\r\nlivid grey to reddish brown. What irritated this mollusc? No doubt the\r\npresence of the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which\r\nits suckers or its jaws had no hold. Yet, what monsters these poulps\r\nare! what vitality the Creator has given them! what vigour in their\r\nmovements! and they possess three hearts! Chance had brought us in\r\npresence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to lose the opportunity\r\nof carefully studying this specimen of cephalopods. I overcame the\r\nhorror that inspired me, and, taking a pencil, began to draw it.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw,” said Conseil.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the Canadian; “for this is whole, and the other had lost\r\nits tail.”\r\n\r\n“That is no reason,” I replied. “The arms and tails of these animals\r\nare re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer’s\r\ncuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow.”\r\n\r\nBy this time other poulps appeared at the port light. I counted seven.\r\nThey formed a procession after the _Nautilus_, and I heard their beaks\r\ngnashing against the iron hull. I continued my work. These monsters\r\nkept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.\r\nSuddenly the _Nautilus_ stopped. A shock made it tremble in every\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n“Have we struck anything?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In any case,” replied the Canadian, “we shall be free, for we are\r\nfloating.”\r\n\r\nThe _Nautilus_ was floating, no doubt, but it did not move. A minute\r\npassed. Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the\r\ndrawing-room. I had not seen him for some time. He seemed dull. Without\r\nnoticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the poulps,\r\nand said something to his lieutenant. The latter went out. Soon the\r\npanels were shut. The ceiling was lighted. I went towards the Captain.\r\n\r\n“A curious collection of poulps?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist,” he replied; “and we are going to fight\r\nthem, man to beast.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him. I thought I had not heard aright.\r\n\r\n“Man to beast?” I repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. The screw is stopped. I think that the horny jaws of one of\r\nthe cuttlefish is entangled in the blades. That is what prevents our\r\nmoving.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin.”\r\n\r\n“A difficult enterprise.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. The electric bullets are powerless against the soft\r\nflesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off. But we shall\r\nattack them with the hatchet.”\r\n\r\n“And the harpoon, sir,” said the Canadian, “if you do not refuse my\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\n“I will accept it, Master Land.”\r\n\r\n“We will follow you,” I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went\r\ntowards the central staircase.\r\n\r\nThere, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.\r\nConseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon. The\r\n_Nautilus_ had then risen to the surface. One of the sailors, posted on\r\nthe top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels. But hardly were\r\nthe screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently\r\ndrawn by the suckers of a poulp’s arm. Immediately one of these arms\r\nslid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above. With\r\none blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle, that\r\nslid wriggling down the ladder. Just as we were pressing one on the\r\nother to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came down\r\non the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with\r\nirresistible power. Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out. We\r\nhurried after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] One of these long arms glided through the opening\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a scene! The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the\r\nsuckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.\r\nHe rattled in his throat, he was stifled, he cried, “Help! help!” These\r\nwords, spoken in French, startled me! I had a fellow-countryman on\r\nboard, perhaps several! That heart-rending cry! I shall hear it all my\r\nlife. The unfortunate man was lost. Who could rescue him from that\r\npowerful pressure? However, Captain Nemo had rushed to the poulp, and\r\nwith one blow of the axe had cut through one arm. His lieutenant\r\nstruggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of\r\nthe _Nautilus_. The crew fought with their axes. The Canadian, Conseil,\r\nand I buried our weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk\r\npenetrated the atmosphere. It was horrible!\r\n\r\nFor one instant, I thought the unhappy man, entangled with the poulp,\r\nwould be torn from its powerful suction. Seven of the eight arms had\r\nbeen cut off. One only wriggled in the air, brandishing the victim like\r\na feather. But just as Captain Nemo and his lieutenant threw themselves\r\non it, the animal ejected a stream of black liquid. We were blinded\r\nwith it. When the cloud dispersed, the cuttlefish had disappeared, and\r\nmy unfortunate countryman with it. Ten or twelve poulps now invaded the\r\nplatform and sides of the _Nautilus_. We rolled pell-mell into the\r\nmidst of this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the platform in the\r\nwaves of blood and ink. It seemed as though these slimy tentacles\r\nsprang up like the hydra’s heads. Ned Land’s harpoon, at each stroke,\r\nwas plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish. But my bold\r\ncompanion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a monster he had\r\nnot been able to avoid.\r\n\r\nAh! how my heart beat with emotion and horror! The formidable beak of a\r\ncuttlefish was open over Ned Land. The unhappy man would be cut in two.\r\nI rushed to his succour. But Captain Nemo was before me; his axe\r\ndisappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, the\r\nCanadian, rising, plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the\r\npoulp.\r\n\r\n“I owed myself this revenge!” said the Captain to the Canadian.\r\n\r\nNed bowed without replying. The combat had lasted a quarter of an hour.\r\nThe monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and\r\ndisappeared under the waves. Captain Nemo, covered with blood, nearly\r\nexhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his\r\ncompanions, and great tears gathered in his eyes."

    "text": "CHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE GULF STREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis terrible scene of the 20th of April none of us can ever forget. I\r\nhave written it under the influence of violent emotion. Since then I\r\nhave revised the recital; I have read it to Conseil and to the\r\nCanadian. They found it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to\r\neffect. To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of the most\r\nillustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep.\r\n\r\nI have said that Captain Nemo wept while watching the waves; his grief\r\nwas great. It was the second companion he had lost since our arrival on\r\nboard, and what a death! That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by the\r\ndreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws, would not rest with\r\nhis comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery! In the midst of the\r\nstruggle, it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that\r\nhad torn my heart. The poor Frenchman, forgetting his conventional\r\nlanguage, had taken to his own mother tongue, to utter a last appeal!\r\nAmongst the crew of the _Nautilus_, associated with the body and soul\r\nof the Captain, recoiling like him from all contact with men, I had a\r\nfellow-countryman. Did he alone represent France in this mysterious\r\nassociation, evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities?\r\nIt was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before\r\nmy mind!\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo entered his room, and I saw him no more for some time. But\r\nthat he was sad and irresolute I could see by the vessel, of which he\r\nwas the soul, and which received all his impressions. The _Nautilus_\r\ndid not keep on in its settled course; it floated about like a corpse\r\nat the will of the waves. It went at random. He could not tear himself\r\naway from the scene of the last struggle, from this sea that had\r\ndevoured one of his men. Ten days passed thus. It was not till the 1st\r\nof May that the _Nautilus_ resumed its northerly course, after having\r\nsighted the Bahamas at the mouth of the Bahama Canal. We were then\r\nfollowing the current from the largest river to the sea, that has its\r\nbanks, its fish, and its proper temperatures. I mean the Gulf Stream.\r\nIt is really a river, that flows freely to the middle of the Atlantic,\r\nand whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters. It is a salt river,\r\nsalter than the surrounding sea. Its mean depth is 1,500 fathoms, its\r\nmean breadth ten miles. In certain places the current flows with the\r\nspeed of two miles and a half an hour. The body of its waters is more\r\nconsiderable than that of all the rivers in the globe. It was on this\r\nocean river that the _Nautilus_ then sailed.\r\n\r\nI must add that, during the night, the phosphorescent waters of the\r\nGulf Stream rivalled the electric power of our watch-light, especially\r\nin the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently. May 8th, we\r\nwere still crossing Cape Hatteras, at the height of North Carolina. The\r\nwidth of the Gulf Stream there is seventy-five miles, and its depth\r\n210 yards. The _Nautilus_ still went at random; all supervision seemed\r\nabandoned. I thought that, under these circumstances, escape would be\r\npossible. Indeed, the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy refuge.\r\nThe sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply between New\r\nYork or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and overrun day and night by\r\nthe little schooners coasting about the several parts of the American\r\ncoast. We could hope to be picked up. It was a favourable opportunity,\r\nnotwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the _Nautilus_ from\r\nthe coasts of the Union. One unfortunate circumstance thwarted the\r\nCanadian’s plans. The weather was very bad. We were nearing those\r\nshores where tempests are so frequent, that country of waterspouts and\r\ncyclones actually engendered by the current of the Gulf Stream. To\r\ntempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction. Ned Land owned\r\nthis himself. He fretted, seized with nostalgia that flight only could\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n“Master,” he said that day to me, “this must come to an end. I must\r\nmake a clean breast of it. This Nemo is leaving land and going up to\r\nthe north. But I declare to you that I have had enough of the South\r\nPole, and I will not follow him to the North.”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now?”\r\n\r\n“We must speak to the Captain,” said he; “you said nothing when we were\r\nin your native seas. I will speak, now we are in mine. When I think\r\nthat before long the _Nautilus_ will be by Nova Scotia, and that there\r\nnear New foundland is a large bay, and into that bay the St. Lawrence\r\nempties itself, and that the St. Lawrence is my river, the river by\r\nQuebec, my native town—when I think of this, I feel furious, it makes\r\nmy hair stand on end. Sir, I would rather throw myself into the sea! I\r\nwill not stay here! I am stifled!”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian was evidently losing all patience. His vigorous nature\r\ncould not stand this prolonged imprisonment. His face altered daily;\r\nhis temper became more surly. I knew what he must suffer, for I was\r\nseized with home-sickness myself. Nearly seven months had passed\r\nwithout our having had any news from land; Captain Nemo’s isolation,\r\nhis altered spirits, especially since the fight with the poulps, his\r\ntaciturnity, all made me view things in a different light.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?” said Ned, seeing I did not reply.\r\n\r\n“Well, Ned, do you wish me to ask Captain Nemo his intentions\r\nconcerning us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Although he has already made them known?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I wish it settled finally. Speak for me, in my name only, if you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“But I so seldom meet him. He avoids me.”\r\n\r\n“That is all the more reason for you to go to see him.”\r\n\r\nI went to my room. From thence I meant to go to Captain Nemo’s. It\r\nwould not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip. I knocked at\r\nthe door. No answer. I knocked again, then turned the handle. The door\r\nopened, I went in. The Captain was there. Bending over his work-table,\r\nhe had not heard me. Resolved not to go without having spoken, I\r\napproached him. He raised his head quickly, frowned, and said roughly,\r\n“You here! What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“To speak to you, Captain.”\r\n\r\n“But I am busy, sir; I am working. I leave you at liberty to shut\r\nyourself up; cannot I be allowed the same?”\r\n\r\nThis reception was not encouraging; but I was determined to hear and\r\nanswer everything.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” I said coldly, “I have to speak to you on a matter that admits\r\nof no delay.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, sir?” he replied, ironically. “Have you discovered\r\nsomething that has escaped me, or has the sea delivered up any new\r\nsecrets?”\r\n\r\nWe were at cross-purposes. But, before I could reply, he showed me an\r\nopen manuscript on his table, and said, in a more serious tone, “Here,\r\nM. Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages. It contains\r\nthe sum of my studies of the sea; and, if it please God, it shall not\r\nperish with me. This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the\r\nhistory of my life, will be shut up in a little floating case. The last\r\nsurvivor of all of us on board the _Nautilus_ will throw this case into\r\nthe sea, and it will go whither it is borne by the waves.”\r\n\r\nThis man’s name! his history written by himself! His mystery would then\r\nbe revealed some day.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” I said, “I can but approve of the idea that makes you act\r\nthus. The result of your studies must not be lost. But the means you\r\nemploy seem to me to be primitive. Who knows where the winds will carry\r\nthis case, and in whose hands it will fall? Could you not use some\r\nother means? Could not you, or one of yours——”\r\n\r\n“Never, sir!” he said, hastily interrupting me.\r\n\r\n“But I and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store;\r\nand, if you will put us at liberty——”\r\n\r\n“At liberty?” said the Captain, rising.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; that is the subject on which I wish to question you. For\r\nseven months we have been here on board, and I ask you to-day, in the\r\nname of my companions and in my own, if your intention is to keep us\r\nhere always?”\r\n\r\n“M. Aronnax, I will answer you to-day as I did seven months ago:\r\nWhoever enters the _Nautilus_, must never quit it.”\r\n\r\n“You impose actual slavery upon us!”\r\n\r\n“Give it what name you please.”\r\n\r\n“But everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Who denies you this right? Have I ever tried to chain you with an\r\noath?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with his arms crossed.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” I said, “to return a second time to this subject will be neither\r\nto your nor to my taste; but, as we have entered upon it, let us go\r\nthrough with it. I repeat, it is not only myself whom it concerns.\r\nStudy is to me a relief, a diversion, a passion that could make me\r\nforget everything. Like you, I am willing to live obscure, in the frail\r\nhope of bequeathing one day, to future time, the result of my labours.\r\nBut it is otherwise with Ned Land. Every man, worthy of the name,\r\ndeserves some consideration. Have you thought that love of liberty,\r\nhatred of slavery, can give rise to schemes of revenge in a nature like\r\nthe Canadian’s; that he could think, attempt, and try——”\r\n\r\nI was silenced; Captain Nemo rose.\r\n\r\n“Whatever Ned Land thinks of, attempts, or tries, what does it matter\r\nto me? I did not seek him! It is not for my pleasure that I keep him on\r\nboard! As for you, M. Aronnax, you are one of those who can understand\r\neverything, even silence. I have nothing more to say to you. Let this\r\nfirst time you have come to treat of this subject be the last, for a\r\nsecond time I will not listen to you.”\r\n\r\nI retired. Our situation was critical. I related my conversation to my\r\ntwo companions.\r\n\r\n“We know now,” said Ned, “that we can expect nothing from this man. The\r\n_Nautilus_ is nearing Long Island. We will escape, whatever the weather\r\nmay be.”\r\n\r\nBut the sky became more and more threatening. Symptoms of a hurricane\r\nbecame manifest. The atmosphere was becoming white and misty. On the\r\nhorizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of\r\ncumuli. Other low clouds passed swiftly by. The swollen sea rose in\r\nhuge billows. The birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels,\r\nthose friends of the storm. The barometer fell sensibly, and indicated\r\nan extreme tension of the vapours. The mixture of the storm glass was\r\ndecomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the\r\natmosphere. The tempest burst on the 18th of May, just as the\r\n_Nautilus_ was floating off Long Island, some miles from the port of\r\nNew York. I can describe this strife of the elements! for, instead of\r\nfleeing to the depths of the sea, Captain Nemo, by an unaccountable\r\ncaprice, would brave it at the surface. The wind blew from the\r\nsouth-west at first. Captain Nemo, during the squalls, had taken his\r\nplace on the platform. He had made himself fast, to prevent being\r\nwashed overboard by the monstrous waves. I had hoisted myself up, and\r\nmade myself fast also, dividing my admiration between the tempest and\r\nthis extraordinary man who was coping with it. The raging sea was swept\r\nby huge cloud-drifts, which were actually saturated with the waves. The\r\n_Nautilus_, sometimes lying on its side, sometimes standing up like a\r\nmast, rolled and pitched terribly. About five o’clock a torrent of rain\r\nfell, that lulled neither sea nor wind. The hurricane blew nearly\r\nforty leagues an hour. It is under these conditions that it overturns\r\nhouses, breaks iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders. However, the\r\n_Nautilus_, in the midst of the tempest, confirmed the words of a\r\nclever engineer, “There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy\r\nthe sea.” This was not a resisting rock; it was a steel spindle,\r\nobedient and movable, without rigging or masts, that braved its fury\r\nwith impunity. However, I watched these raging waves attentively. They\r\nmeasured fifteen feet in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their\r\nspeed of propagation was thirty feet per second. Their bulk and power\r\nincreased with the depth of the water. Such waves as these, at the\r\nHebrides, have displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lbs. They are they\r\nwhich, in the tempest of December 23rd, 1864, after destroying the town\r\nof Yeddo, in Japan, broke the same day on the shores of America. The\r\nintensity of the tempest increased with the night. The barometer, as in\r\n1860 at Reunion during a cyclone, fell seven-tenths at the close of\r\nday. I saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully. She\r\nwas trying to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves. It\r\nwas probably one of the steamers of the line from New York to\r\nLiverpool, or Havre. It soon disappeared in the gloom. At ten o’clock\r\nin the evening the sky was on fire. The atmosphere was streaked with\r\nvivid lightning. I could not bear the brightness of it; while the\r\ncaptain, looking at it, seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest. A\r\nterrible noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of\r\nthe crushed waves, the roaring of the wind, and the claps of thunder.\r\nThe wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone,\r\nrising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and\r\nsouth, in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Ah, that Gulf Stream! It deserves its name of the\r\nKing of Tempests. It is that which causes those formidable cyclones, by\r\nthe difference of temperature between its air and its currents. A\r\nshower of fire had succeeded the rain. The drops of water were changed\r\nto sharp spikes. One would have thought that Captain Nemo was courting\r\na death worthy of himself, a death by lightning. As the _Nautilus_,\r\npitching dreadfully, raised its steel spur in the air, it seemed to act\r\nas a conductor, and I saw long sparks burst from it. Crushed and\r\nwithout strength I crawled to the panel, opened it, and descended to\r\nthe saloon. The storm was then at its height. It was impossible to\r\nstand upright in the interior of the _Nautilus_. Captain Nemo came down\r\nabout twelve. I heard the reservoirs filling by degrees, and the\r\n_Nautilus_ sank slowly beneath the waves. Through the open windows in\r\nthe saloon I saw large fish terrified, passing like phantoms in the\r\nwater. Some were struck before my eyes. The _Nautilus_ was still\r\ndescending. I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we should find a\r\ncalm. But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated for that. We\r\nhad to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in the bowels of\r\nthe deep. But there, what quiet, what silence, what peace! Who could\r\nhave told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of\r\nthat ocean?"

    "text": "CHAPTER XX\r\nFROM LATITUDE 47° 24′ TO LONGITUDE 17° 28′\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the storm, we had been thrown eastward once more. All\r\nhope of escape on the shores of New York or St. Lawrence had faded\r\naway; and poor Ned, in despair, had isolated himself like Captain Nemo.\r\nConseil and I, however, never left each other. I said that the\r\n_Nautilus_ had gone aside to the east. I should have said (to be more\r\nexact) the north-east. For some days, it wandered first on the surface,\r\nand then beneath it, amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors. What\r\naccidents are due to these thick fogs! What shocks upon these reefs\r\nwhen the wind drowns the breaking of the waves! What collisions between\r\nvessels, in spite of their warning lights, whistles, and alarm bells!\r\nAnd the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle, where still\r\nlie all the conquered of the ocean; some old and already encrusted,\r\nothers fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper plates the\r\nbrilliancy of our lantern.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of the Bank of\r\nNewfoundland. This bank consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic\r\nmatter, brought either from the Equator by the Gulf Stream, or from the\r\nNorth Pole by the counter-current of cold water which skirts the\r\nAmerican coast. There also are heaped up those erratic blocks which are\r\ncarried along by the broken ice; and close by, a vast charnel-house of\r\nmolluscs, which perish here by millions. The depth of the sea is not\r\ngreat at Newfoundland—not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but\r\ntowards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms. There the Gulf\r\nStream widens. It loses some of its speed and some of its temperature,\r\nbut it becomes a sea.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 17th of May, about 500 miles from Heart’s Content, at a\r\ndepth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the electric cable lying\r\non the bottom. Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it, thought at\r\nfirst that it was a gigantic sea-serpent. But I undeceived the worthy\r\nfellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the\r\nlaying of this cable. The first one was laid in the years 1857 and\r\n1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any\r\nlonger. In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring 2,000\r\nmiles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on the\r\nGreat Eastern. This attempt also failed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May the _Nautilus_, being at a depth of more than 1,918\r\nfathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which\r\nruined the enterprise. It was within 638 miles of the coast of Ireland;\r\nand at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that\r\ncommunication with Europe had ceased. The electricians on board\r\nresolved to cut the cable before fishing it up, and at eleven o’clock\r\nat night they had recovered the damaged part. They made another point\r\nand spliced it, and it was once more submerged. But some days after it\r\nbroke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured.\r\nThe Americans, however, were not discouraged. Cyrus Field, the bold\r\npromoter of the enterprise, as he had sunk all his own fortune, set a\r\nnew subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable\r\nwas constructed on better principles. The bundles of conducting wires\r\nwere each enveloped in gutta-percha, and protected by a wadding of\r\nhemp, contained in a metallic covering. The Great Eastern sailed on the\r\n13th of July, 1866. The operation worked well. But one incident\r\noccurred. Several times in unrolling the cable they observed that nails\r\nhad recently been forced into it, evidently with the motive of\r\ndestroying it. Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consulted\r\ntogether, and had it posted up that, if the offender was surprised on\r\nboard, he would be thrown without further trial into the sea. From that\r\ntime the criminal attempt was never repeated.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than 500 miles from\r\nNewfoundland, when they telegraphed from Ireland the news of the\r\narmistice concluded between Prussia and Austria after Sadowa. On the\r\n27th, in the midst of heavy fogs, they reached the port of Heart’s\r\nContent. The enterprise was successfully terminated; and for its first\r\ndespatch, young America addressed old Europe in these words of wisdom,\r\nso rarely understood: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,\r\ngoodwill towards men.”\r\n\r\nI did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state,\r\nsuch as it was on leaving the manufactory. The long serpent, covered\r\nwith the remains of shells, bristling with foraminiferae, was encrusted\r\nwith a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring\r\nmolluscs. It lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea, and\r\nunder a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark\r\nwhich passes from Europe to America in .32 of a second. Doubtless this\r\ncable will last for a great length of time, for they find that the\r\ngutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water. Besides, on this\r\nlevel, so well chosen, the cable is never so deeply submerged as to\r\ncause it to break. The _Nautilus_ followed it to the lowest depth,\r\nwhich was more than 2,212 fathoms, and there it lay without any\r\nanchorage; and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken\r\nplace in 1863. The bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100\r\nmiles broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed without its\r\nsummit appearing above the waves. This valley is closed at the east by\r\na perpendicular wall more than 2,000 yards high. We arrived there on\r\nthe 28th of May, and the _Nautilus_ was then not more than 120 miles\r\nfrom Ireland.\r\n\r\nWas Captain Nemo going to land on the British Isles? No. To my great\r\nsurprise he made for the south, once more coming back towards European\r\nseas. In rounding the Emerald Isle, for one instant I caught sight of\r\nCape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving\r\nGlasgow or Liverpool. An important question then arose in my mind. Did\r\nthe _Nautilus_ dare entangle itself in the Manche? Ned Land, who had\r\nre-appeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to question\r\nme. How could I answer? Captain Nemo remained invisible. After having\r\nshown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he going to show\r\nme the coast of France?\r\n\r\nBut the _Nautilus_ was still going southward. On the 30th of May, it\r\npassed in sight of Land’s End, between the extreme point of England and\r\nthe Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard. If we wished to enter\r\nthe Manche, he must go straight to the east. He did not do so.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the 31st of May, the _Nautilus_ described a series\r\nof circles on the water, which greatly interested me. It seemed to be\r\nseeking a spot it had some trouble in finding. At noon, Captain Nemo\r\nhimself came to work the ship’s log. He spoke no word to me, but seemed\r\ngloomier than ever. What could sadden him thus? Was it his proximity\r\nto European shores? Had he some recollections of his abandoned country?\r\nIf not, what did he feel? Remorse or regret? For a long while this\r\nthought haunted my mind, and I had a kind of presentiment that before\r\nlong chance would betray the captain’s secrets.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 1st of June, the _Nautilus_ continued the same\r\nprocess. It was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean.\r\nCaptain Nemo took the sun’s altitude as he had done the day before. The\r\nsea was beautiful, the sky clear. About eight miles to the east, a\r\nlarge steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon. No flag fluttered\r\nfrom its mast, and I could not discover its nationality. Some minutes\r\nbefore the sun passed the meridian, Captain Nemo took his sextant, and\r\nwatched with great attention. The perfect rest of the water greatly\r\nhelped the operation. The _Nautilus_ was motionless; it neither rolled\r\nnor pitched.\r\n\r\nI was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain\r\npronounced these words: “It is here.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and went below. Had he seen the vessel which was changing its\r\ncourse and seemed to be nearing us? I could not tell. I returned to the\r\nsaloon. The panels closed, I heard the hissing of the water in the\r\nreservoirs. The _Nautilus_ began to sink, following a vertical line,\r\nfor its screw communicated no motion to it. Some minutes later it\r\nstopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground. The\r\nluminous ceiling was darkened, then the panels were opened, and through\r\nthe glass I saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of our\r\nlantern for at least half a mile round us.\r\n\r\nI looked to the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet\r\nwaters. But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance,\r\nwhich at once attracted my attention. One would have thought it a ruin\r\nburied under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of\r\nsnow. Upon examining the mass attentively, I could recognise the\r\never-thickening form of a vessel bare of its masts, which must have\r\nsunk. It certainly belonged to past times. This wreck, to be thus\r\nencrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count\r\nmany years passed at the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhat was this vessel? Why did the _Nautilus_ visit its tomb? Could it\r\nhave been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water? I\r\nknew not what to think, when near me in a slow voice I heard Captain\r\nNemo say:\r\n\r\n“At one time this ship was called the Marseillais. It carried\r\nseventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762. In 1778, the 13th of\r\nAugust, commanded by La Poype-Vertrieux, it fought boldly against the\r\nPreston. In 1779, on the 4th of July, it was at the taking of Grenada,\r\nwith the squadron of Admiral Estaing. In 1781, on the 5th of September,\r\nit took part in the battle of Comte de Grasse, in Chesapeake Bay. In\r\n1794, the French Republic changed its name. On the 16th of April, in\r\nthe same year, it joined the squadron of Villaret Joyeuse, at Brest,\r\nbeing entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from America,\r\nunder the command of Admiral Van Stebel. On the 11th and 12th Prairal\r\nof the second year, this squadron fell in with an English vessel. Sir,\r\nto-day is the 13th Prairal, the first of June, 1868. It is now\r\nseventy-four years ago, day for day on this very spot, in latitude 47°\r\n24′, longitude 17° 28′, that this vessel, after fighting heroically,\r\nlosing its three masts, with the water in its hold, and the third of\r\nits crew disabled, preferred sinking with its 356 sailors to\r\nsurrendering; and, nailing its colours to the poop, disappeared under\r\nthe waves to the cry of ‘Long live the Republic!’”\r\n\r\n“The Avenger!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, the Avenger! A good name!” muttered Captain Nemo, crossing\r\nhis arms."

    "text": "CHAPTER XXI\r\nA HECATOMB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of the\r\npatriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this\r\nstrange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the\r\nsignificance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply\r\non my mind. My eyes did not leave the Captain, who, with his hand\r\nstretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious\r\nwreck. Perhaps I was never to know who he was, from whence he came, or\r\nwhere he was going to, but I saw the man move, and apart from the\r\n_savant_. It was no common misanthropy which had shut Captain Nemo and\r\nhis companions within the _Nautilus_, but a hatred, either monstrous or\r\nsublime, which time could never weaken. Did this hatred still seek for\r\nvengeance? The future would soon teach me that. But the _Nautilus_ was\r\nrising slowly to the surface of the sea, and the form of the Avenger\r\ndisappeared by degrees from my sight. Soon a slight rolling told me\r\nthat we were in the open air. At that moment a dull boom was heard. I\r\nlooked at the Captain. He did not move.\r\n\r\n“Captain?” said I.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. I left him and mounted the platform. Conseil and the\r\nCanadian were already there.\r\n\r\n“Where did that sound come from?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was a gunshot,” replied Ned Land.\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction of the vessel I had already seen. It was\r\nnearing the _Nautilus_, and we could see that it was putting on steam.\r\nIt was within six miles of us.\r\n\r\n“What is that ship, Ned?”\r\n\r\n“By its rigging, and the height of its lower masts,” said the Canadian,\r\n“I bet she is a ship-of-war. May it reach us; and, if necessary, sink\r\nthis cursed _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\n“Friend Ned,” replied Conseil, “what harm can it do to the _Nautilus?_\r\nCan it attack it beneath the waves? Can its cannonade us at the bottom\r\nof the sea?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Ned,” said I, “can you recognise what country she belongs\r\nto?”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian knitted his eyebrows, dropped his eyelids, and screwed up\r\nthe corners of his eyes, and for a few moments fixed a piercing look\r\nupon the vessel.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” he replied; “I cannot tell what nation she belongs to, for\r\nshe shows no colours. But I can declare she is a man-of-war, for a long\r\npennant flutters from her main mast.”\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards\r\nus. I could not, however, believe that she could see the _Nautilus_\r\nfrom that distance; and still less that she could know what this\r\nsubmarine engine was. Soon the Canadian informed me that she was a\r\nlarge, armoured, two-decker ram. A thick black smoke was pouring from\r\nher two funnels. Her closely-furled sails were stopped to her yards.\r\nShe hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak. The distance prevented us from\r\ndistinguishing the colours of her pennant, which floated like a thin\r\nribbon. She advanced rapidly. If Captain Nemo allowed her to approach,\r\nthere was a chance of salvation for us.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Ned Land, “if that vessel passes within a mile of us I\r\nshall throw myself into the sea, and I should advise you to do the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\nI did not reply to the Canadian’s suggestion, but continued watching\r\nthe ship. Whether English, French, American, or Russian, she would be\r\nsure to take us in if we could only reach her. Presently a white smoke\r\nburst from the fore part of the vessel; some seconds after, the water,\r\nagitated by the fall of a heavy body, splashed the stern of the\r\n_Nautilus_, and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear.\r\n\r\n“What! they are firing at us!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“So please you, sir,” said Ned, “they have recognised the unicorn, and\r\nthey are firing at us.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I exclaimed, “surely they can see that there are men in the\r\ncase?”\r\n\r\n“It is, perhaps, because of that,” replied Ned Land, looking at me.\r\n\r\nA whole flood of light burst upon my mind. Doubtless they knew now how\r\nto believe the stories of the pretended monster. No doubt, on board the\r\n_Abraham Lincoln_, when the Canadian struck it with the harpoon,\r\nCommander Farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine\r\nvessel, more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean. Yes, it must have\r\nbeen so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of\r\ndestruction. Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, Captain Nemo employed\r\nthe _Nautilus_ in works of vengeance. On the night when we were\r\nimprisoned in that cell, in the midst of the Indian Ocean, had he not\r\nattacked some vessel? The man buried in the coral cemetery, had he not\r\nbeen a victim to the shock caused by the _Nautilus?_ Yes, I repeat it,\r\nit must be so. One part of the mysterious existence of Captain Nemo had\r\nbeen unveiled; and, if his identity had not been recognised, at least,\r\nthe nations united against him were no longer hunting a chimerical\r\ncreature, but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against them. All the\r\nformidable past rose before me. Instead of meeting friends on board the\r\napproaching ship, we could only expect pitiless enemies. But the shot\r\nrattled about us. Some of them struck the sea and ricochetted, losing\r\nthemselves in the distance. But none touched the _Nautilus_. The vessel\r\nwas not more than three miles from us. In spite of the serious\r\ncannonade, Captain Nemo did not appear on the platform; but, if one of\r\nthe conical projectiles had struck the shell of the _Nautilus_, it\r\nwould have been fatal. The Canadian then said, “Sir, we must do all we\r\ncan to get out of this dilemma. Let us signal them. They will then,\r\nperhaps, understand that we are honest folks.”\r\n\r\nNed Land took his handkerchief to wave in the air; but he had scarcely\r\ndisplayed it, when he was struck down by an iron hand, and fell, in\r\nspite of his great strength, upon the deck.\r\n\r\n“Fool!” exclaimed the Captain, “do you wish to be pierced by the spur\r\nof the _Nautilus_ before it is hurled at this vessel?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was terrible to hear; he was still more terrible to see.\r\nHis face was deadly pale, with a spasm at his heart. For an instant it\r\nmust have ceased to beat. His pupils were fearfully contracted. He did\r\nnot speak, he roared, as, with his body thrown forward, he wrung the\r\nCanadian’s shoulders. Then, leaving him, and turning to the ship of\r\nwar, whose shot was still raining around him, he exclaimed, with a\r\npowerful voice, “Ah, ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am! I\r\ndo not want your colours to know you by! Look! and I will show you\r\nmine!”\r\n\r\nAnd on the fore part of the platform Captain Nemo unfurled a black\r\nflag, similar to the one he had placed at the South Pole. At that\r\nmoment a shot struck the shell of the _Nautilus_ obliquely, without\r\npiercing it; and, rebounding near the Captain, was lost in the sea. He\r\nshrugged his shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, “Go down, you\r\nand your companions, go down!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” I cried, “are you going to attack this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I am going to sink it.”\r\n\r\n“You will not do that?”\r\n\r\n“I shall do it,” he replied coldly. “And I advise you not to judge me,\r\nsir. Fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen. The attack has\r\nbegun; go down.”\r\n\r\n“What is this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“You do not know? Very well! so much the better! Its nationality to\r\nyou, at least, will be a secret. Go down!”\r\n\r\nWe could but obey. About fifteen of the sailors surrounded the Captain,\r\nlooking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them. One could\r\nfeel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul. I went down\r\nat the moment another projectile struck the _Nautilus_, and I heard the\r\nCaptain exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Strike, mad vessel! Shower your useless shot! And then, you will not\r\nescape the spur of the _Nautilus_. But it is not here that you shall\r\nperish! I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger!”\r\n\r\nI reached my room. The Captain and his second had remained on the\r\nplatform. The screw was set in motion, and the _Nautilus_, moving with\r\nspeed, was soon beyond the reach of the ship’s guns. But the pursuit\r\ncontinued, and Captain Nemo contented himself with keeping his\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAbout four in the afternoon, being no longer able to contain my\r\nimpatience, I went to the central staircase. The panel was open, and I\r\nventured on to the platform. The Captain was still walking up and down\r\nwith an agitated step. He was looking at the ship, which was five or\r\nsix miles to leeward.\r\n\r\nHe was going round it like a wild beast, and, drawing it eastward, he\r\nallowed them to pursue. But he did not attack. Perhaps he still\r\nhesitated? I wished to mediate once more. But I had scarcely spoken,\r\nwhen Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying:\r\n\r\n“I am the law, and I am the judge! I am the oppressed, and there is the\r\noppressor! Through him I have lost all that I loved, cherished, and\r\nvenerated—country, wife, children, father, and mother. I saw all\r\nperish! All that I hate is there! Say no more!”\r\n\r\nI cast a last look at the man-of-war, which was putting on steam, and\r\nrejoined Ned and Conseil.\r\n\r\n“We will fly!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Ned. “What is this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know; but, whatever it is, it will be sunk before night. In\r\nany case, it is better to perish with it, than be made accomplices in a\r\nretaliation the justice of which we cannot judge.”\r\n\r\n“That is my opinion too,” said Ned Land, coolly. “Let us wait for\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nNight arrived. Deep silence reigned on board. The compass showed that\r\nthe _Nautilus_ had not altered its course. It was on the surface,\r\nrolling slightly. My companions and I resolved to fly when the vessel\r\nshould be near enough either to hear us or to see us; for the moon,\r\nwhich would be full in two or three days, shone brightly. Once on board\r\nthe ship, if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it, we\r\ncould, at least we would, do all that circumstances would allow.\r\nSeveral times I thought the _Nautilus_ was preparing for attack; but\r\nCaptain Nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach,\r\nand then fled once more before it.\r\n\r\nPart of the night passed without any incident. We watched the\r\nopportunity for action. We spoke little, for we were too much moved.\r\nNed Land would have thrown himself into the sea, but I forced him to\r\nwait. According to my idea, the _Nautilus_ would attack the ship at her\r\nwaterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly.\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning, full of uneasiness, I mounted the platform.\r\nCaptain Nemo had not left it. He was standing at the fore part near his\r\nflag, which a slight breeze displayed above his head. He did not take\r\nhis eyes from the vessel. The intensity of his look seemed to attract,\r\nand fascinate, and draw it onward more surely than if he had been\r\ntowing it. The moon was then passing the meridian. Jupiter was rising\r\nin the east. Amid this peaceful scene of nature, sky and ocean rivalled\r\neach other in tranquillity, the sea offering to the orbs of night the\r\nfinest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their image. As\r\nI thought of the deep calm of these elements, compared with all those\r\npassions brooding imperceptibly within the _Nautilus_, I shuddered.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was within two miles of us. It was ever nearing that\r\nphosphorescent light which showed the presence of the _Nautilus_. I\r\ncould see its green and red lights, and its white lantern hanging from\r\nthe large foremast. An indistinct vibration quivered through its\r\nrigging, showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost.\r\nSheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels, shining in the\r\natmosphere like stars.\r\n\r\nI remained thus until six in the morning, without Captain Nemo noticing\r\nme. The ship stood about a mile and a half from us, and with the first\r\ndawn of day the firing began afresh. The moment could not be far off\r\nwhen, the _Nautilus_ attacking its adversary, my companions and myself\r\nshould for ever leave this man. I was preparing to go down to remind\r\nthem, when the second mounted the platform, accompanied by several\r\nsailors. Captain Nemo either did not or would not see them. Some steps\r\nwere taken which might be called the signal for action. They were very\r\nsimple. The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered, and the\r\nlantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were\r\nflush with the deck. The long surface of the steel cigar no longer\r\noffered a single point to check its manœuvres. I returned to the\r\nsaloon. The _Nautilus_ still floated; some streaks of light were\r\nfiltering through the liquid beds. With the undulations of the waves\r\nthe windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun, and\r\nthis dreadful day of the 2nd of June had dawned.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock, the log showed that the speed of the _Nautilus_ was\r\nslackening, and I knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer.\r\nBesides, the reports were heard more distinctly, and the projectiles,\r\nlabouring through the ambient water, were extinguished with a strange\r\nhissing noise.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said I, “the moment is come. One grasp of the hand, and\r\nmay God protect us!”\r\n\r\nNed Land was resolute, Conseil calm, myself so nervous that I knew not\r\nhow to contain myself. We all passed into the library; but the moment I\r\npushed the door opening on to the central staircase, I heard the upper\r\npanel close sharply. The Canadian rushed on to the stairs, but I\r\nstopped him. A well-known hissing noise told me that the water was\r\nrunning into the reservoirs, and in a few minutes the _Nautilus_ was\r\nsome yards beneath the surface of the waves. I understood the manœuvre.\r\nIt was too late to act. The _Nautilus_ did not wish to strike at the\r\nimpenetrable cuirass, but below the water-line, where the metallic\r\ncovering no longer protected it.\r\n\r\nWe were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama\r\nthat was preparing. We had scarcely time to reflect; taking refuge in\r\nmy room, we looked at each other without speaking. A deep stupor had\r\ntaken hold of my mind: thought seemed to stand still. I was in that\r\npainful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report. I waited, I\r\nlistened, every sense was merged in that of hearing! The speed of the\r\n_Nautilus_ was accelerated. It was preparing to rush. The whole ship\r\ntrembled. Suddenly I screamed. I felt the shock, but comparatively\r\nlight. I felt the penetrating power of the steel spur. I heard\r\nrattlings and scrapings. But the _Nautilus_, carried along by its\r\npropelling power, passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle\r\nthrough sailcloth!\r\n\r\nI could stand it no longer. Mad, out of my mind, I rushed from my room\r\ninto the saloon. Captain Nemo was there, mute, gloomy, implacable; he\r\nwas looking through the port panel. A large mass cast a shadow on the\r\nwater; and, that it might lose nothing of her agony, the _Nautilus_ was\r\ngoing down into the abyss with her. Ten yards from me I saw the open\r\nshell, through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder,\r\nthen the double line of guns and the netting. The bridge was covered\r\nwith black, agitated shadows.\r\n\r\nThe water was rising. The poor creatures were crowding the ratlines,\r\nclinging to the masts, struggling under the water. It was a human\r\nant-heap overtaken by the sea. Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, my\r\nhair standing on end, with eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and\r\nwithout voice, I too was watching! An irresistible attraction glued me\r\nto the glass! Suddenly an explosion took place. The compressed air blew\r\nup her decks, as if the magazines had caught fire. Then the unfortunate\r\nvessel sank more rapidly. Her topmast, laden with victims, now\r\nappeared; then her spars, bending under the weight of men; and, last of\r\nall, the top of her mainmast. Then the dark mass disappeared, and with\r\nit the dead crew, drawn down by the strong eddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned to Captain Nemo. That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of\r\nhatred, was still looking. When all was over, he turned to his room,\r\nopened the door, and entered. I followed him with my eyes. On the end\r\nwall beneath his heroes, I saw the portrait of a woman, still young,\r\nand two little children. Captain Nemo looked at them for some moments,\r\nstretched his arms towards them, and, kneeling down, burst into deep\r\nsobs."

    "text": "CHAPTER XXII\r\nTHE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panels had closed on this dreadful vision, but light had not\r\nreturned to the saloon: all was silence and darkness within the\r\n_Nautilus_. At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, it\r\nwas leaving this desolate spot. Whither was it going? To the north or\r\nsouth? Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation? I\r\nhad returned to my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained silent\r\nenough. I felt an insurmountable horror for Captain Nemo. Whatever he\r\nhad suffered at the hands of these men, he had no right to punish thus.\r\nHe had made me, if not an accomplice, at least a witness of his\r\nvengeance. At eleven the electric light reappeared. I passed into the\r\nsaloon. It was deserted. I consulted the different instruments. The\r\n_Nautilus_ was flying northward at the rate of twenty-five miles an\r\nhour, now on the surface, and now thirty feet below it. On taking the\r\nbearings by the chart, I saw that we were passing the mouth of the\r\nManche, and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas\r\nat a frightful speed. That night we had crossed two hundred leagues of\r\nthe Atlantic. The shadows fell, and the sea was covered with darkness\r\nuntil the rising of the moon. I went to my room, but could not sleep. I\r\nwas troubled with dreadful nightmare. The horrible scene of destruction\r\nwas continually before my eyes. From that day, who could tell into what\r\npart of the North Atlantic basin the _Nautilus_ would take us? Still\r\nwith unaccountable speed. Still in the midst of these northern fogs.\r\nWould it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova Zembla? Should\r\nwe explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea of Kara, the Gulf\r\nof Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown coast of Asia? I\r\ncould not say. I could no longer judge of the time that was passing.\r\nThe clocks had been stopped on board. It seemed, as in polar countries,\r\nthat night and day no longer followed their regular course. I felt\r\nmyself being drawn into that strange region where the foundered\r\nimagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will. Like the fabulous Gordon Pym,\r\nat every moment I expected to see “that veiled human figure, of larger\r\nproportions than those of any inhabitant of the earth, thrown across\r\nthe cataract which defends the approach to the pole.” I estimated\r\n(though, perhaps, I may be mistaken)—I estimated this adventurous\r\ncourse of the _Nautilus_ to have lasted fifteen or twenty days. And I\r\nknow not how much longer it might have lasted, had it not been for the\r\ncatastrophe which ended this voyage. Of Captain Nemo I saw nothing\r\nwhatever now, nor of his second. Not a man of the crew was visible for\r\nan instant. The _Nautilus_ was almost incessantly under water. When we\r\ncame to the surface to renew the air, the panels opened and shut\r\nmechanically. There were no more marks on the planisphere. I knew not\r\nwhere we were. And the Canadian, too, his strength and patience at an\r\nend, appeared no more. Conseil could not draw a word from him; and,\r\nfearing that, in a dreadful fit of madness, he might kill himself,\r\nwatched him with constant devotion. One morning (what date it was I\r\ncould not say) I had fallen into a heavy sleep towards the early hours,\r\na sleep both painful and unhealthy, when I suddenly awoke. Ned Land was\r\nleaning over me, saying, in a low voice, “We are going to fly.” I sat\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“When shall we go?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“To-night. All inspection on board the _Nautilus_ seems to have ceased.\r\nAll appear to be stupefied. You will be ready, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; where are we?”\r\n\r\n“In sight of land. I took the reckoning this morning in the fog—twenty\r\nmiles to the east.”\r\n\r\n“What country is it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know; but, whatever it is, we will take refuge there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ned, yes. We will fly to-night, even if the sea should swallow us\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“The sea is bad, the wind violent, but twenty miles in that light boat\r\nof the _Nautilus_ does not frighten me. Unknown to the crew, I have\r\nbeen able to procure food and some bottles of water.”\r\n\r\n“I will follow you.”\r\n\r\n“But,” continued the Canadian, “if I am surprised, I will defend\r\nmyself; I will force them to kill me.”\r\n\r\n“We will die together, friend Ned.”\r\n\r\nI had made up my mind to all. The Canadian left me. I reached the\r\nplatform, on which I could with difficulty support myself against the\r\nshock of the waves. The sky was threatening; but, as land was in those\r\nthick brown shadows, we must fly. I returned to the saloon, fearing and\r\nyet hoping to see Captain Nemo, wishing and yet not wishing to see him.\r\nWhat could I have said to him? Could I hide the involuntary horror with\r\nwhich he inspired me? No. It was better that I should not meet him face\r\nto face; better to forget him. And yet—— How long seemed that day, the\r\nlast that I should pass in the _Nautilus_. I remained alone. Ned Land\r\nand Conseil avoided speaking, for fear of betraying themselves. At six\r\nI dined, but I was not hungry; I forced myself to eat in spite of my\r\ndisgust, that I might not weaken myself. At half-past six Ned Land came\r\nto my room, saying, “We shall not see each other again before our\r\ndeparture. At ten the moon will not be risen. We will profit by the\r\ndarkness. Come to the boat; Conseil and I will wait for you.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian went out without giving me time to answer. Wishing to\r\nverify the course of the _Nautilus_, I went to the saloon. We were\r\nrunning N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yards deep. I\r\ncast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of art\r\nheaped up in this museum, upon the unrivalled collection destined to\r\nperish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it. I wished\r\nto fix an indelible impression of it in my mind. I remained an hour\r\nthus, bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling, and passing in\r\nreview those treasures shining under their glasses. Then I returned to\r\nmy room.\r\n\r\nI dressed myself in strong sea clothing. I collected my notes, placing\r\nthem carefully about me. My heart beat loudly. I could not check its\r\npulsations. Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me\r\nto Captain Nemo’s eyes. What was he doing at this moment? I listened at\r\nthe door of his room. I heard steps. Captain Nemo was there. He had not\r\ngone to rest. At every moment I expected to see him appear, and ask me\r\nwhy I wished to fly. I was constantly on the alert. My imagination\r\nmagnified everything. The impression became at last so poignant that I\r\nasked myself if it would not be better to go to the Captain’s room, see\r\nhim face to face, and brave him with look and gesture.\r\n\r\nIt was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately I resisted the desire,\r\nand stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation. My nerves\r\nwere somewhat calmer, but in my excited brain I saw over again all my\r\nexistence on board the _Nautilus;_ every incident, either happy or\r\nunfortunate, which had happened since my disappearance from the\r\n_Abraham Lincoln_—the submarine hunt, the Torres Straits, the savages\r\nof Papua, the running ashore, the coral cemetery, the passage of Suez,\r\nthe Island of Santorin, the Cretan diver, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the\r\niceberg, the South Pole, the imprisonment in the ice, the fight among\r\nthe poulps, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and the horrible\r\nscene of the vessel sunk with all her crew. All these events passed\r\nbefore my eyes like scenes in a drama. Then Captain Nemo seemed to grow\r\nenormously, his features to assume superhuman proportions. He was no\r\nlonger my equal, but a man of the waters, the genie of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was then half-past nine. I held my head between my hands to keep it\r\nfrom bursting. I closed my eyes; I would not think any longer. There\r\nwas another half-hour to wait, another half-hour of a nightmare, which\r\nmight drive me mad.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard the distant strains of the organ, a sad harmony\r\nto an undefinable chant, the wail of a soul longing to break these\r\nearthly bonds. I listened with every sense, scarcely breathing;\r\nplunged, like Captain Nemo, in that musical ecstasy, which was drawing\r\nhim in spirit to the end of life.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had left his room. He\r\nwas in the saloon, which I must cross to fly. There I should meet him\r\nfor the last time. He would see me, perhaps speak to me. A gesture of\r\nhis might destroy me, a single word chain me on board.\r\n\r\nBut ten was about to strike. The moment had come for me to leave my\r\nroom, and join my companions.\r\n\r\nI must not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo himself should rise before\r\nme. I opened my door carefully; and even then, as it turned on its\r\nhinges, it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise. Perhaps it only\r\nexisted in my own imagination.\r\n\r\nI crept along the dark stairs of the _Nautilus_, stopping at each step\r\nto check the beating of my heart. I reached the door of the saloon, and\r\nopened it gently. It was plunged in profound darkness. The strains of\r\nthe organ sounded faintly. Captain Nemo was there. He did not see me.\r\nIn the full light I do not think he would have noticed me, so entirely\r\nwas he absorbed in the ecstasy.\r\n\r\nI crept along the carpet, avoiding the slightest sound which might\r\nbetray my presence. I was at least five minutes reaching the door, at\r\nthe opposite side, opening into the library.\r\n\r\nI was going to open it, when a sigh from Captain Nemo nailed me to the\r\nspot. I knew that he was rising. I could even see him, for the light\r\nfrom the library came through to the saloon. He came towards me\r\nsilently, with his arms crossed, gliding like a spectre rather than\r\nwalking. His breast was swelling with sobs; and I heard him murmur\r\nthese words (the last which ever struck my ear):\r\n\r\n“Almighty God! enough! enough!”\r\n\r\nWas it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man’s\r\nconscience?\r\n\r\nIn desperation, I rushed through the library, mounted the central\r\nstaircase, and, following the upper flight, reached the boat. I crept\r\nthrough the opening, which had already admitted my two companions.\r\n\r\n“Let us go! let us go!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Directly!” replied the Canadian.\r\n\r\nThe orifice in the plates of the _Nautilus_ was first closed, and\r\nfastened down by means of a false key, with which Ned Land had provided\r\nhimself; the opening in the boat was also closed. The Canadian began to\r\nloosen the bolts which still held us to the submarine boat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a noise was heard. Voices were answering each other loudly.\r\nWhat was the matter? Had they discovered our flight? I felt Ned Land\r\nslipping a dagger into my hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I murmured, “we know how to die!”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian had stopped in his work. But one word many times repeated,\r\na dreadful word, revealed the cause of the agitation spreading on board\r\nthe _Nautilus_. It was not we the crew were looking after!\r\n\r\n“The maelstrom! the maelstrom!” Could a more dreadful word in a more\r\ndreadful situation have sounded in our ears! We were then upon the\r\ndangerous coast of Norway. Was the _Nautilus_ being drawn into this\r\ngulf at the moment our boat was going to leave its sides? We knew that\r\nat the tide the pent-up waters between the islands of Ferroe and\r\nLoffoden rush with irresistible violence, forming a whirlpool from\r\nwhich no vessel ever escapes. From every point of the horizon enormous\r\nwaves were meeting, forming a gulf justly called the “Navel of the\r\nOcean,” whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve\r\nmiles. There, not only vessels, but whales are sacrificed, as well as\r\nwhite bears from the northern regions.\r\n\r\nIt is thither that the _Nautilus_, voluntarily or involuntarily, had\r\nbeen run by the Captain.\r\n\r\nIt was describing a spiral, the circumference of which was lessening by\r\ndegrees, and the boat, which was still fastened to its side, was\r\ncarried along with giddy speed. I felt that sickly giddiness which\r\narises from long-continued whirling round.\r\n\r\nWe were in dread. Our horror was at its height, circulation had\r\nstopped, all nervous influence was annihilated, and we were covered\r\nwith cold sweat, like a sweat of agony! And what noise around our frail\r\nbark! What roarings repeated by the echo miles away! What an uproar was\r\nthat of the waters broken on the sharp rocks at the bottom, where the\r\nhardest bodies are crushed, and trees worn away, “with all the fur\r\nrubbed off,” according to the Norwegian phrase!\r\n\r\nWhat a situation to be in! We rocked frightfully. The _Nautilus_\r\ndefended itself like a human being. Its steel muscles cracked.\r\nSometimes it seemed to stand upright, and we with it!\r\n\r\n“We must hold on,” said Ned, “and look after the bolts. We may still be\r\nsaved if we stick to the _Nautilus_.”\r\n\r\nHe had not finished the words, when we heard a crashing noise, the\r\nbolts gave way, and the boat, torn from its groove, was hurled like a\r\nstone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool.\r\n\r\nMy head struck on a piece of iron, and with the violent shock I lost\r\nall consciousness."

    "text": "CHAPTER XXIII\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThus ends the voyage under the seas. What passed during that night—how\r\nthe boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom—how Ned Land,\r\nConseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nBut when I returned to consciousness, I was lying in a fisherman’s hut,\r\non the Loffoden Isles. My two companions, safe and sound, were near me\r\nholding my hands. We embraced each other heartily.\r\n\r\nAt that moment we could not think of returning to France. The means of\r\ncommunication between the north of Norway and the south are rare. And I\r\nam therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from\r\nCape North.\r\n\r\nAnd, among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, I revise\r\nmy record of these adventures once more. Not a fact has been omitted,\r\nnot a detail exaggerated. It is a faithful narrative of this incredible\r\nexpedition in an element inaccessible to man, but to which Progress\r\nwill one day open a road.\r\n\r\nShall I be believed? I do not know. And it matters little, after all.\r\nWhat I now affirm is, that I have a right to speak of these seas, under\r\nwhich, in less than ten months, I have crossed 20,000 leagues in that\r\nsubmarine tour of the world, which has revealed so many wonders.\r\n\r\nBut what has become of the _Nautilus?_ Did it resist the pressure of\r\nthe maelstrom? Does Captain Nemo still live? And does he still follow\r\nunder the ocean those frightful retaliations? Or, did he stop after the\r\nlast hecatomb?\r\n\r\nWill the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the\r\nhistory of his life? Shall I ever know the name of this man? Will the\r\nmissing vessel tell us by its nationality that of Captain Nemo?\r\n\r\nI hope so. And I also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the\r\nsea at its most terrible gulf, and that the _Nautilus_ has survived\r\nwhere so many other vessels have been lost! If it be so—if Captain Nemo\r\nstill inhabits the ocean, his adopted country, may hatred be appeased\r\nin that savage heart! May the contemplation of so many wonders\r\nextinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance! May the judge disappear,\r\nand the philosopher continue the peaceful exploration of the sea! If\r\nhis destiny be strange, it is also sublime. Have I not understood it\r\nmyself? Have I not lived ten months of this unnatural life? And to the\r\nquestion asked by Ecclesiastes three thousand years ago, “That which is\r\nfar off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?” two men alone of all\r\nnow living have the right to give an answer——\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN NEMO AND MYSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 164 ***"
