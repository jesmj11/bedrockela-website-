## Key Changes from Original:

### ❌ REMOVED (Too Basic for 1st Grade):
- Teaching individual letter sounds (Kindergarten skill)
- Letter identification lessons
- Single phonogram focus

### ✅ ADDED (Appropriate 1st Grade):
- **Immediate word building** from Day 1
- **Word families** to build patterns
- **More sight words** earlier
- **Reading comprehension** from the start
- **Fluency practice** built in
- **Two-syllable words** introduced earlier
- **More complex vocabulary**

### 🎯 Standards Alignment:
- **RF.1.3b**: Decode regularly spelled one-syllable words
- **RF.1.3c**: Know final -e and vowel teams
- **RF.1.3g**: Recognize irregularly spelled words
- **RF.1.4**: Read with sufficient accuracy and fluency

---

## Implementation Notes:

1. **Pre-Assessment Recommended**: Test if students know all letters/sounds
2. **For Struggling Students**: Consider starting with kindergarten review
3. **For Advanced Students**: Move faster through CVC, focus on fluency
4. **Keep the Games**: Word building games, sorting activities, hands-on fun
5. **Keep the Stories**: Same beloved stories, just more appropriate skill focus
