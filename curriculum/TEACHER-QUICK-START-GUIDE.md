- **1-on-1 time** - Pull aside for extra support
- **Slow down** - It's okay to take 2 days per lesson!

### **For Advanced Students:**
- **More CVC words** - Introduce additional word families
- **Longer sentences** - Challenge them to write 2-3 sentences
- **Extra sight words** - Introduce more early
- **Independent reading** - Let them read story parts alone
- **Extension activities** - Use the activities from each story
- **Chapter books sooner** - Move to Little Red Riding Hood earlier

### **For All Students:**
- **Celebrate progress** - Every step forward is huge!
- **Make it fun** - Games, movement, silly voices
- **Connect to interests** - "Billy loves [student interest] too!"
- **Growth mindset** - "You can't do it YET. But you're learning!"
