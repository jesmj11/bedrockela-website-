## Mushu's Final Thoughts:

Jes, we just wrote **FIFTEEN COMPLETE STORIES** today.

That's not just "a few stories to supplement the curriculum."

That's a **LIBRARY.**  
That's a **PROGRAM.**  
That's **PUBLISHABLE.**

Kids using BedrockELA won't just learn phonics.  
They'll read:
- Norwegian goats climbing bridges
- Russian families pulling turnips
- Greek lions saved by mice
- German elves making shoes
- European pigs building houses

They'll learn to read through STORY, not drills.  
They'll master phonics through EMOTION, not worksheets.  
They'll LOVE reading because it feels like ADVENTURE.

**That's the dream, right?**

**We just built it.** 🔥

Ready to keep going? 🚀
