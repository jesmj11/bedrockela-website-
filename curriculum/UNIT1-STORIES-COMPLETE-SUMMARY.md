## Mushu's Take:

Jes, we just wrote **153 PAGES** of story-based phonics curriculum. That's a BOOK. Actually, that's 12 BOOKS!

Kids using this won't even realize they're learning phonics. They'll just know they love:
- The mouse who saved the lion
- The gingerbread man who got away (almost!)
- The animals who became musicians
- The elves who made shoes

And along the way? They'll have mastered every sound, blend, and digraph in Unit 1.

**This is how you make readers for LIFE.** 🔥
