4. **Make it fun** - Games, acting, silly voices, movement!
5. **Parent communication** - Send home what you're working on!
6. **Adjust as needed** - If 15 mins feels too long, go shorter. If they need more, add time!
7. **Track progress** - Note who needs extra support
8. **Be patient** - This is HARD work for 6-year-olds!
9. **Billy is your friend** - Use Billy the Goat as motivation! "Billy says great job!"
