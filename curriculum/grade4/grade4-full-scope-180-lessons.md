Curriculum Overview
This 180-day 4th grade ELA curriculum is built entirely on public domain literature, meaning every text is free to reproduce, adapt, and distribute without royalty or copyright concerns. The curriculum is organized into six units, each anchored by a major novel and supported by folk tales, myths, poetry, and nonfiction from around the world. Every lesson ties reading comprehension to specific CCSS standards through carefully selected passages with text-dependent questions.
The design philosophy is immersive: students become so engaged in the stories that comprehension skills develop naturally. Each unit spirals key skills (citing evidence, determining theme, comparing texts) while introducing new complexity.
Writing Philosophy: Every Day from Day 1
Writing is not a separate subject in this curriculum — it is woven into every single day so that students build the habit long before they encounter formal essays. The progression is intentional:
Unit 1 (Days 1-30): Daily reading journals (2-3 sentences → paragraphs). First narrative (hero's journey story). First text-evidence paragraph using ACE structure. Students write every day for 30 days and don't realize they're 'learning to write.'
Unit 2 (Days 31-60): Journals continue. POV rewrites (creative scene writing from different perspectives). First comparison writing in journals. First informational paragraph (pirates). Second complete narrative (adventure story). Writing feels like playing with stories.
Unit 3 (Days 61-90): Journals add figurative language hunts and theme tracking. Descriptive nature writing. Poetry writing. Second informational compare/contrast paragraph. FIRST MULTI-PARAGRAPH ESSAY (theme comparison). Students write their first essay without fear because every component skill was already practiced.
Unit 4 (Days 91-120): Travel journal project (sustained multi-entry writing blending narrative + informational). Mini-research paragraphs at each cultural stop. Travel guide assessment integrating multiple sources. Opinion writing sneaks in through journal reflections.
Unit 5 (Days 121-150): Vocabulary journals replace reading journals. Formal opinion writing taught (but students recognize they've been doing it all along). Multiple opinion essays of increasing complexity. Wordplay and poetry writing. Capstone opinion essay spanning all books read this year.
Unit 6 (Days 151-180): All three writing types converge. Research project (topic selection → notes → draft → revise → present). Year-spanning theme essay across 3+ novels. Reflection writing. By Day 180, students have written every day for an entire year and produced narratives, informational pieces, opinion essays, poetry, journals, and a research report.
The result: By the time students encounter any formal writing assessment, they have been writing daily for months. Nothing is a surprise. Nothing is scary. They are writers.

JOURNALS CONTINUE (daily paragraph). New prompt type: POV detective. 'Find 3 sentences where Jim uses "I" or "me." Rewrite ONE of them as if a narrator outside the story were telling it. What changes?' This is the first taste of POV rewriting — low stakes, just one sentence at a time (W.4.10, RL.4.6).

36-40
How POV shapes understanding; unreliable narration; Treasure Island Ch. 6-12
RL.4.6, RL.4.1, RL.4.5, W.4.3
Treasure Island Ch. 6-12 (The Captain's Papers through Council of War)
Passage: Jim overhears Long John Silver's secret plan in the apple barrel. Questions: What does Jim know that adults don't? (RL.4.6), how does this create suspense? (RL.4.5), what would this look like from Silver's POV? (RL.4.6).
FIRST POV REWRITE. Students rewrite the apple barrel scene (1 paragraph) from Long John Silver's perspective. 'What is Silver thinking and feeling while he talks? He doesn't know Jim is listening — write it from inside Silver's head.' Mini-lesson: 1st person voice — how different characters sound different even though both use 'I' (W.4.3, L.4.3). Share rewrites aloud and compare — whose Silver sounds most convincing?

Treasure Island Ch. 13-20 (island arrival through Silver's embassy)
Passage: Jim sneaks away and finds Ben Gunn. Questions: Plot the rising action on a story mountain (RL.4.5), how has Jim changed? (RL.4.3).
EXTENDED POV REWRITE (full scene). Students choose any scene from Ch. 13-20 and rewrite it from a different character's POV (Silver, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett). This time it's a full page, not just a paragraph. Planning day, drafting day, revision day. Focus: maintaining consistent voice throughout and using descriptive details the new narrator would notice (W.4.3, L.4.3). Mini-lesson: strong verbs vs. weak verbs ('He went to the cave' vs. 'He crept toward the cave').

RL.4.9, RL.4.6, RL.4.2, W.4.10
Treasure Island Ch. 21-28; Sinbad the Sailor (Voyages 1-2 from Arabian Nights)
Passage: Sinbad describes the Roc bird. Paired with Jim's island discovery. Questions: Both are 1st person — how do voices differ? (RL.4.6), compare adventure patterns (RL.4.9), cultural settings (RL.4.9).
JOURNALS: COMPARISON WRITING INTRO. Daily journal prompt shifts to comparison: 'Write 4-5 sentences comparing Jim and Sinbad. How are they similar? How are they different? Use one example from each story.' This is the gentle introduction to compare/contrast writing — no formal essay yet, just practiced thinking in journal form (W.4.10). Mini-lesson: Transition words for comparison (both, however, similarly, on the other hand) (L.4.3).

51-55
Nonfiction pairing: real pirates; finish Treasure Island Ch. 29-34
RI.4.3, RI.4.5, RI.4.6, RL.4.9, W.4.2

Paired text: How do fictional pirates compare to real ones? (RL.4.9, RI.4.6). Author's purpose fiction vs. nonfiction (RI.4.6), text structure (RI.4.5). Vocabulary: brigantine, mutiny, parley.
FIRST INFORMATIONAL PARAGRAPH. Students write one paragraph: 'How were real pirates different from the pirates in Treasure Island? Use one fact from the nonfiction and one detail from the novel.' This is their first W.4.2 task, but it's just one paragraph and it's about pirates, so it doesn't feel like 'informational writing.' Mini-lesson: How to introduce a fact ('According to the article...' / 'The text states that...') (W.4.2, W.4.8 intro).
12
56-60
Unit assessment; POV writing project; vocabulary review
RL.4.6, W.4.3, W.4.2, SL.4.4
Robinson Crusoe excerpt (finding the footprint); student choice passages
Assessment: Read Robinson Crusoe excerpt; identify POV, compare to Jim Hawkins (RL.4.6, RL.4.9).
ADVENTURE NARRATIVE PROJECT. Students write an original 1st-person adventure story (1.5-2 pages). Requirements: 1st-person narrator with a distinct voice, a clear story mountain (rising action/climax/resolution), descriptive details, and dialogue. Planning → drafting → peer revision → final copy. Author's chair presentations (SL.4.4). Add to class library of student-written books. Students have now written TWO complete narratives this year (W.4.3, L.4.1, L.4.2, L.4.3).

UNIT 3: Theme, Figurative Language & the Natural World
Anchor: The Call of the Wild (Jack London) & The Jungle Book (Rudyard Kipling)    |    Standards: RL.4.2, RL.4.4, RL.4.1, RL.4.3, RI.4.1, RI.4.4, W.4.1, W.4.2, W.4.3, W.4.10, L.4.3, L.4.5, L.4.4
A dual-novel unit pairing two powerful stories about animals and survival. Students deepen their understanding of theme, explore figurative language (simile, metaphor, personification, imagery), and analyze how authors use nature as a setting and symbol. Poetry by Robert Frost and Walt Whitman enriches the figurative language strand. Nonfiction pairing: Lewis & Clark journals.
✍ Writing: Writing Strand: Reading journals continue daily. New focus: descriptive and poetic writing. Students write nature descriptions loaded with figurative language, compare/contrast paragraphs, and their own poetry. By Week 18, students complete a figurative language portfolio and a theme comparison essay (their first multi-paragraph essay). Standards: W.4.1, W.4.2, W.4.3, W.4.10, L.4.3, L.4.5.

JOURNALS: FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE HUNT. Daily journal now includes a 'language treasure' section: students copy one interesting sentence from the reading and explain why the author chose those words. End of week: students write their own descriptive paragraph about an animal using at least 2 similes. 'Describe a wolf, tiger, or snake using comparisons. Make me SEE it.' Share favorites aloud (W.4.10, L.4.5).

Passage: Kaa hypnotizes the monkeys. Questions: How does Kipling give animals human qualities? (L.4.5), what words create danger? (RL.4.4), Mowgli's human and animal skills (RL.4.3).
PERSONIFICATION WRITING. Students write a 1-paragraph story from an animal's perspective using personification. 'Pick any animal. Write about its day as if it thinks and feels like a human — but it's still an animal.' This connects directly to the POV rewrites they did in Unit 2 (they already know how to write from a different perspective) but now adds figurative language. Mini-lesson: the difference between personification and just making an animal talk (W.4.3, L.4.5).
15
71-75
Theme development; launch Call of the Wild Ch. 1-3
RL.4.2, RL.4.3, RL.4.1, W.4.10
The Call of the Wild Ch. 1-3 (Into the Primitive, Law of Club and Fang, Dominant Primordial Beast)
Passage: Buck is taken from home and learns the law of club and fang. Questions: What is Buck learning about survival? (RL.4.2), how is Buck changing? (RL.4.1, RL.4.3). Compare to Mowgli's lessons (RL.4.9).
JOURNALS: THEME TRACKING. New journal element: 'Theme Tracker' — a running log where students write one sentence per reading session about what the book might be saying about a big idea (belonging, survival, identity). 'What is Jack London trying to tell us about where Buck belongs? Write your thinking — it's okay if it changes!' Also: compare/contrast paragraph comparing Mowgli and Buck (4-5 sentences). This builds on the comparison journal work from Unit 2 but is slightly more structured (W.4.10).

76-80
Theme across texts; imagery and mood; Call of the Wild Ch. 4-5; Robert Frost poetry
RL.4.2, RL.4.4, RL.4.9, L.4.5, W.4.3
Call of the Wild Ch. 4-5; Robert Frost: 'The Road Not Taken,' 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'
Passage: Buck runs with the wolf pack. Paired with Frost's 'Stopping by Woods.' Questions: What theme about nature do both share? (RL.4.2), metaphors in the poem (L.4.5a), how does imagery create mood? (RL.4.4).
POETRY WRITING. After studying Frost, students write their own nature poem (free verse, no pressure to rhyme). Requirements: at least one simile, one metaphor, and vivid imagery. 'Write a poem about a place in nature. Make the reader feel like they're there.' 2 days drafting, 1 day peer sharing and revision. Mini-lesson: line breaks in poetry — why poets choose where to end a line (W.4.3, L.4.5). Poems displayed on classroom 'poetry wall.'
17
81-85
Nonfiction pairing: Lewis & Clark journals; comparing literary and informational descriptions; finish Call of the Wild Ch. 6-7
RI.4.1, RI.4.4, RL.4.9, W.4.2
Call of the Wild Ch. 6-7; Lewis & Clark journal excerpts (encountering grizzlies, describing the frontier)
Paired passages: London's fictional Yukon vs. Lewis & Clark's journal. Questions: How do fiction and nonfiction describe nature differently? (RL.4.9, RI.4.4), author's purpose (RI.4.6).
INFORMATIONAL COMPARE/CONTRAST PARAGRAPH. Students write one strong paragraph comparing how London and Lewis & Clark describe the wilderness. Must include one quote or detail from each text. This is their second W.4.2 piece (first was pirates in Unit 2), and it builds on all the comparison practice from journals. Mini-lesson: How to smoothly introduce a quote in your own writing (W.4.2, W.4.8). Students are now comfortable writing informational paragraphs without it ever being formally 'taught' as a scary new genre.
18
86-90
Unit assessment; figurative language portfolio; poetry recitation; Walt Whitman
RL.4.2, RL.4.4, L.4.5, SL.4.4, W.4.1
Walt Whitman: 'O Captain! My Captain!'; Emily Dickinson selected poems; student-selected poems
Assessment: (1) Figurative language identification in new passage (L.4.5). (2) Theme comparison essay (see writing column).
FIRST MULTI-PARAGRAPH ESSAY. Prompt: 'How do The Jungle Book and The Call of the Wild explore the theme of belonging? Use evidence from both books.' Structure: Introduction (state the theme), Body 1 (Jungle Book evidence), Body 2 (Call of the Wild evidence), Conclusion (what both books teach us). This is the FIRST formal essay, but students have been building every skill it requires: text evidence (Unit 1), comparison (Unit 2 journals + Unit 3), topic sentences (Unit 1 journals), and transition words (Unit 2). 2 days drafting, 1 day revision, 1 day final. ALSO: Figurative language portfolio compiled (all poems, descriptive paragraphs, language treasures from journals). Poetry recitation performance (W.4.1, SL.4.4).

UNIT 4: Cultures, Geography & Informational Text
Anchor: Around the World in 80 Days (Jules Verne)    |    Standards: RI.4.1, RI.4.2, RI.4.3, RI.4.5, RI.4.7, RI.4.9, RL.4.2, RL.4.9, W.4.2, W.4.3, W.4.7, W.4.8, W.4.10, L.4.4
The anchor novel propels students on a global journey, with each stop paired with a folk tale or nonfiction from that region. This unit emphasizes informational text structures, text features, comparing accounts, and integrating information from multiple sources. Folk tales from Africa (Anansi), India (Panchatantra), Japan (Momotaro), China (Journey to the West), Arabia (Ali Baba), Russia (Baba Yaga), and Scandinavia (Norse myths).
✍ Writing: Writing Strand: The travel journal becomes the spine of writing in this unit — students write an entry at every 'stop' on Fogg's journey, blending narrative description with informational facts. Short research paragraphs at each cultural stop build W.4.2 and W.4.7 skills. By Week 24, students produce a polished travel guide integrating multiple sources. Standards: W.4.2, W.4.3, W.4.7, W.4.8, W.4.10.

Passage: Fogg makes his wager at the Reform Club. Questions: Sequence the events (RI.4.5), what do Fogg's actions reveal? (RL.4.3), cause and effect of the bet (RI.4.3).
LAUNCH TRAVEL JOURNAL. Students create a travel journal that they'll add to throughout the unit. Entry #1: London. 'You are traveling with Phileas Fogg. Describe London as you leave. What do you see, hear, smell? Include one real fact about London.' This blends narrative (W.4.3) and informational (W.4.2) writing naturally. Journals continue daily alongside the travel journal. Mini-lesson: Vivid sensory details in descriptive writing (L.4.3).

TRAVEL JOURNAL ENTRY #2: India. Students write a journal entry blending what Fogg experiences with facts they researched. ALSO: First mini-research paragraph. Students find 3 facts about India from the novel + folk tale + nonfiction source and write one paragraph synthesizing them. 'What did you learn about India from three different texts?' This is W.4.7 in action but feels like exploring, not 'research.' Lesson 100 celebration: students illustrate their favorite travel journal page (W.4.2, W.4.7).

TRAVEL JOURNAL ENTRIES #3-4: Hong Kong and Japan. For Japan, students write a comparison entry: 'How is Japan described in Verne's novel vs. the Momotaro folk tale? Which feels more real to you and why?' This is opinion writing sneaking in through the journal format — students are forming and defending opinions without it being labeled 'opinion writing' yet (W.4.3, W.4.10). Mini-lesson: Using specific examples to support your point (connects to ACE from Unit 1).

Must include an introduction, at least 3 facts, and a conclusion (W.4.2, W.4.7). Day 5: Presentations with visuals (SL.4.4, SL.4.5). WRITING MILESTONE: Students have now written narratives, informational paragraphs, comparisons, opinion pieces, poetry, and a sustained multi-entry journal project.

UNIT 5: Language, Logic & Opinion Writing
Anchor: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Lewis Carroll)    |    Standards: RL.4.4, L.4.4, L.4.5, L.4.6, W.4.1, W.4.3, W.4.10, RL.4.1, RL.4.2, RL.4.6, SL.4.3, L.4.1, L.4.2, L.4.3

This unit formalizes opinion/argument writing. Paired with Edward Lear's nonsense poetry, Aesop's fables, and Edgar Allan Poe's poetry.
✍ Writing: Writing Strand: Formal opinion writing is now the focus, but it builds on the opinion work students have been doing in journals and travel entries all year. Students learn the full opinion essay structure (claim, reasons, evidence, conclusion) and write multiple opinion pieces of increasing complexity. Also: vocabulary journals replace reading journals to strengthen word consciousness. Standards: W.4.1, W.4.3, W.4.10, L.4.1, L.4.2, L.4.3, L.4.4, L.4.5, L.4.6.

RL.4.4, L.4.4, RL.4.1, W.4.10
Alice in Wonderland Ch. 1-3 (Down the Rabbit Hole, Pool of Tears, Caucus Race)
Passage: Alice falls down the rabbit hole and finds the 'DRINK ME' bottle. Questions: Context clues for 'curious' (L.4.4a), Alice's character (RL.4.3). Vocabulary strategy: Greek and Latin roots.
LAUNCH VOCABULARY JOURNALS. Reading journals evolve into vocabulary journals. Each day: (1) Write one new word from the reading, (2) copy the sentence it appeared in, (3) guess the meaning from context, (4) write your own sentence using the word. This replaces the daily reading response and keeps the writing habit alive while building vocabulary. ALSO: Quick-write opinion prompt (10 min): 'Would you drink the DRINK ME bottle? Why or why not? Give two reasons.' Students realize they've been writing opinions all year — this just has a name now (W.4.10, L.4.4).

Passage: Mad Hatter's riddle and tea party wordplay. Questions: Find 3 examples of wordplay (L.4.5), multiple meanings (RL.4.4). Paired with Lear: How do both use language for humor? (RL.4.9).
WORDPLAY WRITING. Students write their own nonsense poem or short nonsense scene inspired by Carroll and Lear. 'Make up a conversation where the characters misunderstand each other because words have multiple meanings.' This is pure play — the sillier the better. Share aloud and vote on the funniest. Vocabulary journals continue daily. Mini-lesson: Puns — how to make a word do double duty (W.4.3, L.4.5, W.4.10).

Passage: The Queen sentences everyone. Questions: Is the Queen a fair ruler? (W.4.1, RL.4.1). Aesop: What argument does each fable make? (SL.4.3). Vocabulary: verdict, fury, impertinent.
FORMAL OPINION WRITING TAUGHT. Day 1: Analyze Aesop's fables as 'arguments' — what is the claim? What is the evidence? What is the moral (conclusion)? Students see that opinion writing is a structure they already understand from fables. Day 2: Teach the opinion essay framework: Claim → Reason 1 + Evidence → Reason 2 + Evidence → Conclusion. Day 3-4: Write opinion paragraph: 'Is the Queen of Hearts a fair ruler? Support your answer with evidence from the text.' Day 5: Peer review using a checklist (Does it have a clear claim? Evidence from the text? A conclusion?). Mini-lesson: Difference between opinion and fact; how to make a claim debatable (W.4.1, L.4.1).

OPINION ESSAY #2 (multi-paragraph). Prompt: 'Which author creates a stronger mood — Carroll or Poe? Write an essay explaining your opinion with evidence from both texts.' This is their first multi-paragraph opinion essay: Introduction with claim, Body 1 (Carroll evidence), Body 2 (Poe evidence), Conclusion. They wrote their first multi-paragraph essay in Unit 3 (theme comparison), so the structure isn't new — only the opinion framing is. Planning day, 2 drafting days, revision day with peer feedback. Mini-lesson: Counter-arguments — acknowledging the other side ('While some might say Carroll is stronger because...') (W.4.1, L.4.3).

VOCABULARY SHOWCASE + POETRY WRITING. Students choose 10 favorite words from their vocabulary journals and write a 'word museum' — each word gets a display card with the word, definition, original sentence, their own sentence, and an illustration or example. ALSO: Students write an original poem inspired by Dickinson using extended metaphor. 'Pick an emotion. Describe it as if it were a living thing, a place, or an object. Never name the emotion directly.' Vocabulary journals continue (W.4.3, L.4.4, L.4.6, W.4.10).

Support your opinion with evidence from at least two texts.' This essay reaches across the entire year — students must recall and cite multiple novels. Full writing process: plan (Day 1), draft (Day 2-3), peer review and revise (Day 4), final copy (Day 5). This is the culminating opinion piece and students should feel confident because they've been building to this all year. Poetry performance + word museum presentations (W.4.1, SL.4.4, SL.4.6). WRITING MILESTONE: Students have now mastered narrative, informational, AND opinion writing.

Students apply all comprehension strategies while launching a research project that integrates fiction with nonfiction. Paired with nonfiction about Victorian England, botany, Magellan/Marco Polo primary sources. Culminates in the Reading Summit celebration.
✍ Writing: Writing Strand: All three writing types converge in this unit. Students write narrative responses to the novel, informational research reports, and opinion/reflection essays — often blending all three in a single piece.
