UNIT 1  •  LESSON 2 OF 180
A Very Strange Landing
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 2: The Council with the Munchkins

📚  Welcome!
Welcome back! Yesterday, Dorothy’s house got swept up by a cyclone and carried far, far away. Today you’re going to find out where it landed — and trust us, it’s not what you’d expect.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 2 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Answer questions about Dorothy’s new surroundings
•  Write in your reading journal
•  Learn a new vocabulary word

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Yesterday you noticed that Kansas was described as gray and dull. Keep that in your mind as you read today’s chapter.

Think about this: If you could land anywhere in the world — real or imaginary — where would you want your house to come down?

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  How is this new place different from Kansas?
•  Who does Dorothy meet?
•  What problem does Dorothy have right away?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 2: The Council with the Munchkins
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 2: “The Council with the Munchkins.”

This chapter is a little longer than Chapter 1. Take your time — there’s a lot of new information coming at Dorothy all at once. She’s just as confused as you might be!

💡 Reading tip: When you meet new characters, try to remember their names and one thing about them. It’ll help later.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
wilderness  (noun)
A wild, natural area where few or no people live.

From the story: Baum describes the land of the Munchkins as lush and beautiful — very different from the gray Kansas wilderness Dorothy grew up in.

Think about it: How is the “wilderness” of Kansas different from the land of the Munchkins? What words does the author use to show the difference?
