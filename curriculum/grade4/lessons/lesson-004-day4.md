UNIT 1  •  LESSON 4 OF 180
The Man Made of Tin
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 4: The Road Through the Forest & Chapter 5: The Rescue of the Tin Woodman

📚  Welcome!
Dorothy and the Scarecrow are walking down the yellow brick road together. Today they’ll enter a dark forest and find someone who’s been stuck in the same spot for a very long time. You’re reading two shorter chapters today!

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapters 4 and 5 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Meet another important character
•  Compare two characters
•  Write in your reading journal

Time: About 50 minutes (two chapters today!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
You’ve met Dorothy (wants to go home) and the Scarecrow (wants a brain). A pattern is forming — characters who are missing something important. Watch for it.

Think about this: What do you think is more important — being smart (having a brain) or being kind (having a heart)? There’s no wrong answer here.

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  Who do Dorothy and the Scarecrow find in the forest?
•  What does this new character want?
•  How is his wish different from the Scarecrow’s?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 4: The Road Through the Forest & Chapter 5: The Rescue of the Tin Woodman
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 4: “The Road Through the Forest” and Chapter 5: “The Rescue of the Tin Woodman.”

Chapter 4 is very short. Chapter 5 is where the real action happens. You can read them both in one sitting.

💡 Reading tip: The Tin Woodman tells a long story about his past. Pay attention — it explains why he wants what he wants.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
tenderly  (adverb)
In a gentle, caring, loving way.

From the story: The Tin Woodman tells Dorothy he once loved a girl “tenderly” — but without a heart, he can no longer feel love.

Think about it: Why is it sad that the Tin Woodman used to do things tenderly but now says he can’t? What does that tell you about what he’s lost?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you read.

1. Why is the Tin Woodman stuck in the forest?
A) He is lost and doesn’t know the way
B) He has rusted and cannot move
C) A witch put a spell on him
D) He is too scared to leave

2. What does the Tin Woodman want the Wizard to give him?
A) A brain
B) Courage
C) A heart
D) A new body

3. How did the Tin Woodman become made of tin?
A) He was born that way
B) A witch enchanted his axe and it slowly cut away his body, which was replaced with tin
C) He fell into a magical river
D) The Wizard turned him into tin

4. The Scarecrow wants a brain. The Tin Woodman wants a heart. Which do you think is more important? Use an example from the story to explain your thinking.
💡 Hint: Think about what each character CAN already do, even without the thing they want.
[Your answer]

5. The Tin Woodman cries when he’s sad — but says he has no heart. Does that seem strange to you? What might the author be trying to show us?
💡 Hint: If someone cries because they feel sad, what does that tell you about whether they really have feelings?
[Your answer]


✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal
Today’s journal entry (2-3 sentences):

•  Compare the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. How are they similar? How are they different?
•  Do you think the Tin Woodman already has a heart? Why or why not?
•  Which character is your favorite so far? Why?

💡 Reminder: You read two chapters today! You can write about either one (or both).
