UNIT 1  •  LESSON 5 OF 180
The Cowardly Lion
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 6: The Cowardly Lion

📚  Welcome!
The group is growing! Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman are all headed to the Emerald City. But there’s one more friend to meet. This one might surprise you.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 6 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Meet the last main character and think about what courage means
•  Look at the pattern of characters in this story
•  Write in your reading journal
•  Celebrate — you’ve finished your first week!

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
So far, every new character is missing something: Dorothy (home), Scarecrow (brain), Tin Woodman (heart). The author is building a pattern. Let’s see if it continues.

Think about this: What does it mean to be brave? Is someone brave only if they’re never scared? Or can you be brave AND scared at the same time?

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  Who is the new character, and what does he want?
•  Does the pattern continue?
•  What does the Lion do that seems brave, even though he says he’s not?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 6: The Cowardly Lion
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 6: “The Cowardly Lion.”

This chapter is fun because the Lion is not what you’d expect. Pay attention to the contradiction: he’s a big, powerful lion who says he’s afraid of everything.

💡 Reading tip: Notice how each character in Dorothy’s group wants something they think they don’t have. The author is doing this on purpose. Ask yourself: why?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
courage  (noun)
The ability to do something even when you’re afraid. Being brave even when it’s hard.

From the story: “The Lion says he has no courage, and yet he leaps out to frighten the travelers — which takes courage in itself.”

Think about it: Can someone who says they have no courage actually be brave? What’s the difference between courage and not being afraid at all?

1. What does the Cowardly Lion want from the Wizard?
A) A brain

3. What does Dorothy do when the Lion tries to bite Toto?

4. Dorothy slaps a lion on the nose to protect her dog. What character trait does that show? Do you think Dorothy knows she has this trait?
💡 Hint: Think about what it takes to stand up to something much bigger and stronger than you.

5. We’ve now met all four main characters. Each one wants something: home, a brain, a heart, courage. Do you notice anything interesting about whether they already have the thing they want? Explain.
