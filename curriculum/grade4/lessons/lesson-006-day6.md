UNIT 1  •  LESSON 6 OF 180
Into the Danger Zone
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 7: The Journey to the Great Oz

📚  Welcome!
Welcome to Week 2! Last week you met all four main characters. This week, the adventure gets harder — and more exciting. The road to the Emerald City is full of dangers.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 7 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Track how characters respond to challenges
•  Answer questions and write in your journal
•  Learn a new vocabulary word

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Last week, each character told us what they’re missing. This week, watch what they actually DO when trouble hits. Their actions might tell a different story than their words.

Think about this: Have you ever surprised yourself by doing something you didn’t think you could do? What was it?

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  What dangers does the group face in this chapter?
•  Which character steps up to help? Does it surprise you?
•  Who shows bravery, smarts, or heart — even though they say they don’t have it?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 7: The Journey to the Great Oz
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 7: “The Journey to the Great Oz.”

This chapter has several small challenges the group faces on the road. Keep track of who does what. It matters.

💡 Reading tip: After each challenge the group faces, pause and ask: Who solved this problem? What quality did they use?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
comrade  (noun)
A close companion, someone you share a journey or experience with. Like a teammate on an adventure.

From the story: The four travelers become true comrades as they face dangers together on the road.

Think about it: What makes someone a comrade instead of just a friend? How are Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Lion becoming comrades?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you read.

1. What is the first challenge the group faces in this chapter?
A) A great ditch they must cross
B) A thunderstorm
C) An attack by flying monkeys
D) Getting lost in a cave

2. Who comes up with the plan to get across the ditch?
A) Dorothy
B) The Cowardly Lion
C) The Scarecrow
D) The Tin Woodman

3. What does this tell us about the Scarecrow?
A) He is the strongest in the group
B) He is able to think of solutions, even though he says he has no brain
C) He is the bravest character
D) He wants to go back to his cornfield

4. The Scarecrow says he has no brain, but he’s the one solving problems. The Lion says he has no courage, but he carries everyone across dangers. What do you think the author is trying to show us?
💡 Hint: Sometimes people already have what they’re looking for. They just don’t see it yet.
[Your answer]

5. Pick one character. Describe one thing they did in this chapter that shows they might already have what they’re wishing for.
💡 Hint: Look for actions, not words. What did they DO, not what did they SAY?
[Your answer]


✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal
Today’s journal entry (2-3 sentences):

•  Which character impressed you the most in this chapter? What did they do?
•  Do you think the characters are starting to realize they already have what they want? Why or why not?
•  Describe one challenge from the chapter and how the group solved it.

💡 Reminder: When you write about what a character did, try to say WHY it matters. “The Scarecrow came up with a plan, which shows that...”

🌟  You’re Done!
Great work today! Here’s what you accomplished:

✅  Read Chapter 7 — survived the dangers on the road!
✅  Learned a new vocabulary word (comrade)
✅  Tracked character actions vs. character words
✅  Wrote in your reading journal (Day 6!)

Tomorrow in Lesson 7, the group will face one of the most famous scenes in the whole book — a field of flowers that’s much more dangerous than it looks.

See you next lesson, reader. 📚
