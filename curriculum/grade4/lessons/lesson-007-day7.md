The Deadly Poppy Field
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 8: The Deadly Poppy Field

📚  Welcome!
Flowers. Beautiful, bright red flowers as far as you can see. Sounds lovely, right? Not this time. Today’s chapter is one of the most suspenseful in the whole book.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 8 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Think about cause and effect
•  Notice how teamwork saves the day
•  Write in your reading journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
In stories, things that look safe can sometimes be dangerous. The author is about to use this trick on you.

Think about this: Can you think of something in real life that looks harmless but can actually be dangerous? (Maybe something in nature?)

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  What happens when the group walks through the poppies?
•  Why are some characters affected and others aren’t?
•  How does the group solve this problem?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 8: The Deadly Poppy Field
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 8: “The Deadly Poppy Field.”

This is a great chapter for noticing cause and effect — one thing causes another, which causes another. It’s like a chain reaction.

💡 Reading tip: Cause and effect means asking “What happened?” and “Why did it happen?” Try to connect events like links in a chain.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
poisonous  (adjective)
Containing something harmful that can make you sick or cause damage, even if it looks safe.

From the story: The beautiful poppies are poisonous — their smell puts anyone who breathes it into a deep sleep they might never wake up from.

Think about it: Why is it more dangerous when something harmful looks beautiful? How does this connect to the idea that “things aren’t always what they seem”?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding

2. Why aren’t the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman affected?
A) They held their breath
B) They ran through the field quickly
C) They are not made of flesh and don’t breathe

3. Which is the best example of cause and effect from this chapter?
