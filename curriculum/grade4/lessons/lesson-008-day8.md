UNIT 1  •  LESSON 8 OF 180
The Emerald City at Last
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 9: The Queen of the Field Mice & Chapter 10: The Guardian of the Gates

📚  Welcome!
The poppy field is behind them. Today the group gets closer to the Emerald City — and you’ll finally get to see it! But first, a tiny queen has a big role to play. Two chapters today!

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapters 9 and 10 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Notice how settings are described
•  Think about why the Emerald City looks the way it does
•  Write in your reading journal

Time: About 50 minutes (two chapters!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Remember how Kansas was gray and dull? The land of the Munchkins was colorful and bright. The author uses colors and descriptions on purpose. Watch what he does with the Emerald City.

Think about this: If you could build a city that was entirely one color, what color would you choose? Why?

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  How does the Lion get rescued from the poppy field?
•  What is the Emerald City like? What details stand out?
•  What must everyone wear in the Emerald City? Why?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 9: The Queen of the Field Mice & Chapter 10: The Guardian of the Gates
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 9: “The Queen of the Field Mice” and Chapter 10: “The Guardian of the Gates.”

Chapter 9 wraps up the poppy field rescue. Chapter 10 is where the Emerald City comes alive. Pay attention to every detail about what it looks like.

💡 Reading tip: When an author spends a lot of time describing a place, slow down and try to picture it in your head. What do you see?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
dazzling  (adjective)
So bright and impressive that it’s almost overwhelming. Something that amazes your eyes.

From the story: The Emerald City is described as dazzling — everything is green and glittering and almost too bright to look at.

Think about it: Why might the author make the Emerald City so dazzling? Think back to gray Kansas. What’s the contrast telling you?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding

1. How is the Lion saved from the poppy field?

3. Think about the settings in this book so far: gray Kansas, colorful Munchkin land, dark forest, beautiful-but-deadly poppy field, dazzling Emerald City. What do you notice about how the author uses settings? What pattern do you see?
💡 Hint: Think about how each new place has its own mood and color. Why might the author be doing this?
[Your answer]

4. Everyone has to wear green glasses in the Emerald City. Do you think the city is actually green, or does it just look green because of the glasses? What might the author be trying to say?
💡 Hint: Remember the theme of appearance vs. reality. Things in this story aren’t always what they seem.
[Your answer]
