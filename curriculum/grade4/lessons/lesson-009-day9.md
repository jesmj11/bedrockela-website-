UNIT 1  •  LESSON 9 OF 180
The Great and Terrible Oz
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 11: The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz

📚  Welcome!
This is it. Dorothy and her friends finally get to meet the Wizard. But here’s the thing about the Wizard of Oz — he’s not exactly what anyone expected. Pay very close attention today.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 11 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Notice how the Wizard appears differently to each character
•  Make predictions about what’s really going on
•  Write in your reading journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
We’ve been hearing about the “great and powerful Oz” since Chapter 2. Every character is hoping the Wizard can give them what they’re missing. But remember the theme we’ve been tracking: things aren’t always what they seem.

Think about this: Have you ever been really excited to meet someone or go somewhere, and then it wasn’t what you expected? What happened?

🔍 What to look for while you read:
•  The Wizard looks different to each person who visits him. What does he look like each time?
•  Does the Wizard agree to help them right away?
•  What does the Wizard want in return?

📖  Part 2: Read — Chapter 11: The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 11: “The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz.”

This is a really important chapter. The Wizard appears in four different forms to four different characters. Keep track of what form he takes each time.

💡 Reading tip: Ask yourself — if the Wizard looks different every time, what does that tell you about him? Is he hiding something?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
terrible  (adjective)
In this book, “terrible” means “causing fear or awe” — not just “bad.” The Wizard is called “The Great and Terrible” because he is powerful and frightening.

From the story: “Oz, the Great and Terrible” — the name is meant to make people afraid and impressed at the same time.

Think about it: Why would someone want to be called “terrible”? What’s the advantage of making people afraid of you?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you read.

1. What does the Wizard look like when Dorothy sees him?
A) A beautiful fairy

2. What does the Wizard tell Dorothy she must do before he will help her?
A) Find the silver shoes
B) Kill the Wicked Witch of the West
C) Bring him a golden crown
D) Walk around the Emerald City three times

3. Why is it suspicious that the Wizard looks different to each visitor?
A) Wizards always change their appearance
B) It suggests he might be using tricks and isn’t what he seems
C) It means he is very powerful
D) It is completely normal in Oz

4. The Wizard appears as a giant head to Dorothy, a beautiful fairy to the Scarecrow, a terrible beast to the Tin Woodman, and a ball of fire to the Lion. Why do you think he shows a different form to each one? What might he be doing?
💡 Hint: Think about what would be most impressive or scary to each character.

5. Make a prediction: Do you think the Wizard is truly great and powerful, or is something else going on? Explain your thinking using at least one clue from the story.

✍️  Part 5: Your Reading Journal
