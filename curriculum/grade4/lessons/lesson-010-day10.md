UNIT 1  •  LESSON 10 OF 180
Looking Back, Looking Ahead
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Review & Chapter 12: The Search for the Wicked Witch

📚  Welcome!
Ten lessons in! Before we dive deeper into the story, let’s pause and look at how far you’ve come. You’ve read 11 chapters, met all the main characters, and written 9 journal entries. That’s seriously impressive.

Today is a little different. You’ll read a new chapter AND look back at the story so far.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 12 of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Review the story so far with a character chart
•  Write a longer journal entry reflecting on the first 11 chapters
•  Think about the big ideas (themes) in this story

Time: About 50-55 minutes (a little longer today!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Before you read today’s chapter, let’s take stock of what we know. Fill in this character chart from memory (it’s okay to flip back through your book to check!):

Dorothy: Wants ________________. One thing she’s done that shows who she really is: ________________.
Scarecrow: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.
Tin Woodman: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.
Cowardly Lion: Wants ________________. One thing he’s done that shows he might already have it: ________________.

🔍 What to look for in Chapter 12:
•  How does the Wicked Witch find out the group is coming?
•  What weapons does the Witch use against them?
•  Do the characters show their “missing” qualities during the battle?

📖  Part 2: Read — Review & Chapter 12: The Search for the Wicked Witch
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 12: “The Search for the Wicked Witch.”

This is an action-packed chapter. The Wicked Witch of the West sends several attacks at the group. Pay attention to how each character responds when things get really scary.

💡 Reading tip: This is a long chapter with a lot happening. It’s okay to pause in the middle and take a breath. If you need to, re-read a section that was confusing. Good readers re-read all the time.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
melancholy  (adjective / noun)
A deep, quiet sadness. Not dramatic crying, but a heavy, lingering feeling of sadness.

From the story: The Tin Woodman feels melancholy when he thinks about the heart he lost. It’s not a loud sadness — it’s a quiet ache.

Think about it: What’s the difference between being sad and being melancholy? Can you think of a time you felt melancholy instead of just plain sad?

✅  Part 4: Check Your Understanding

3. Thinking about the whole story so far — which statement best describes a theme (big idea) of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?
A) Witches are always evil
B) You might already have what you’re looking for inside you
C) Home is a boring place

4. Look back at the character chart you filled in before reading. Pick one character and write 2-3 sentences explaining how they have shown their “missing” quality through their ACTIONS in the story, even though they say they don’t have it.
💡 Hint: Use specific examples. “The Scarecrow says he has no brain, but in Chapter 7 he came up with the plan to...”
[Your answer]

5. We’re about halfway through the book. The biggest theme we’ve seen is: “You might already have what you’re looking for.” Do you agree or disagree that the characters already have what they want? Use at least two examples from the story.
