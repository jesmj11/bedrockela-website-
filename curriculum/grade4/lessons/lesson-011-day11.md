UNIT 1  •  LESSON 11 OF 180
Behind the Curtain
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 13: The Rescue & Chapter 14: The Winged Monkeys

📚  Welcome!
Dorothy defeated the Wicked Witch (with a bucket of water, of all things!). Now the group is heading back to the Emerald City to collect on the Wizard’s promise. But will the Wizard keep his word?

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapters 13 and 14
•  Learn about the Winged Monkeys’ backstory
•  Practice summarizing
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Wicked Witch is gone. Dorothy has the Golden Cap and the silver shoes. The group should be celebrating, right? But they still haven’t gotten what they came for.

Think about this: Have you ever completed a hard task only to realize there’s still more to do? How did that feel?

🔍 What to look for:
•  How do the Winged Monkeys help Dorothy?
•  What is the Monkeys’ story? Why do they obey the Golden Cap?
•  What happens when the group returns to the Emerald City?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 13: “The Rescue” and Chapter 14: “The Winged Monkeys.”

Chapter 13 is short. Chapter 14 includes a backstory about the Winged Monkeys — it explains their history. Backstories give you new information about a character’s past.

💡 Reading tip: Summarizing means retelling the most important parts in your own words — not every detail, just the big events. Try to summarize each chapter in one sentence after you read it.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
captive  (noun / adjective)
A person or creature that is held prisoner and not free to leave.

From the story: The Winkies were captives of the Wicked Witch. When Dorothy defeated the Witch, they were finally free.

Think about it: How does it feel to go from being a captive to being free? How do you think the Winkies felt?
