🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Remember the green glasses everyone has to wear in the Emerald City? Remember how the Wizard looked different to everyone? The author has been dropping clues. Today, those clues pay off.

Think about this: Have you ever discovered that something you believed was real turned out to be fake or exaggerated? How did you feel?

🔍 What to look for:
•  What is the Wizard’s secret?
•  How does each character react?
•  What is the main idea of this chapter?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 15: “The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible.”

This chapter changes everything. Read slowly and enjoy the moment when the truth comes out.

💡 Reading tip: The main idea is the most important point the author is making. It’s not a detail — it’s the BIG message. After reading, ask: “What is this chapter really about?”

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
humbug  (noun)
A fraud or fake. Someone who deceives people by pretending to be something they’re not.

From the story: “I’m just a common man,” the Wizard admits. He’s a humbug — he was never magical at all.

Think about it: Is the Wizard a bad person for being a humbug, or was he just doing what he thought he had to do? Can someone be a fraud but still be a good person?
