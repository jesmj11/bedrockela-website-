UNIT 1  •  LESSON 13 OF 180
Brains, Heart, and Courage
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapter 16: The Magic Art of the Great Humbug

📚  Welcome!
The Wizard is a fake. Everyone knows it now. But he made a promise, and today he’s going to try to keep it — in the cleverest way possible.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapter 16
•  Think about whether the Wizard’s “gifts” are real
•  Dig deeper into theme
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Wizard has no magic. So how can he give the Scarecrow a brain, the Tin Woodman a heart, and the Lion courage? Watch closely — and think about whether what he gives them is real or symbolic.

Think about this: Can someone GIVE you confidence, or do you have to find it yourself? What if someone just tells you that you already have it?

🔍 What to look for:
•  What does the Wizard give each character?
•  Are the gifts real?
•  Do the characters feel different afterward? Why?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 16: “The Magic Art of the Great Humbug.”

This is a short but powerful chapter. The Wizard gives each character a “gift” — but are they what they seem?

💡 Reading tip: Theme is the big lesson or message the author wants you to take away from the story. This chapter is dripping with theme. Ask yourself: What is L. Frank Baum really saying about brains, hearts, and courage?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
wisdom  (noun)
The ability to use knowledge and experience to make good decisions. It’s more than just being smart — it’s knowing how to USE what you know.

From the story: The Wizard tells the Scarecrow that true wisdom comes from experience, not from what’s inside your head.

Think about it: Is wisdom the same as being smart? Can someone be smart but not wise? Can someone be wise without knowing a lot of facts?

✅  Check Your Understanding

1. What does the Wizard give the Scarecrow for a “brain”?
A) A real human brain
B) A magic potion
C) Bran, pins, and needles stuffed in his head
D) A book of knowledge

2. Why do the characters feel satisfied with their gifts even though they’re not real?
A) The Wizard cast a secret spell
B) They believe they have what they wanted, and that belief makes the difference

3. The Wizard gives fake brains, a fake heart, and fake courage. But the characters are happy. What is the author’s message? What is the theme?
💡 Hint: Think about this: Did the characters need the Wizard at all? What did they really need?

4. Do you think the Wizard did the right thing by giving fake gifts? Or should he have told them the truth — that they already had brains, heart, and courage all along? Explain your opinion.

✍️  Your Reading Journal
Today’s journal entry (paragraph):

•  In your own words, what is the theme of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz? What is the author trying to teach us?
•  Do you think the Wizard is wise? Why or why not?
