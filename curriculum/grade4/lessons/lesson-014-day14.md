UNIT 1  •  LESSON 14 OF 180
The Balloon and Glinda
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapters 17-18: How the Balloon Was Launched & Away to the South

📚  Welcome!
Everyone else got what they wanted. But what about Dorothy? She still needs to get home to Kansas. Today, the Wizard tries one more thing — and Dorothy’s journey takes another turn.

Today you will: 
•  Read Chapters 17 and 18
•  Track Dorothy’s journey toward home
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Wizard gave brains, a heart, and courage. But Dorothy’s wish is different — she wants to go HOME. Can a humbug wizard get her there?

Think about this: What makes a place feel like home? Is it the building? The people? The memories?

🔍 What to look for:
•  What is the Wizard’s plan to get Dorothy home?
•  Does it work?
•  Who does Dorothy go to see next for help?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy and read Chapter 17: “How the Balloon Was Launched” and Chapter 18: “Away to the South.”

The Wizard’s balloon plan is... well, you’ll see. Then the group heads south to find Glinda, the Good Witch. The journey isn’t over yet.

💡 Reading tip: We’re getting close to the end. Start thinking about how everything connects. How has Dorothy changed from Chapter 1?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
journey  (noun)
A long trip, especially one that changes you along the way. A journey is more than just travel — it’s about growth.

From the story: Dorothy’s journey through Oz has changed her. She started as a lonely girl in gray Kansas and became a brave leader with loyal friends.

Think about it: What’s the difference between a trip and a journey? How has Dorothy’s journey changed her?
