UNIT 1  •  LESSON 15 OF 180
There’s No Place Like Home
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  •  Chapters 19-24 (Final Chapters)

📚  Welcome!
This is it — the final chapters of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Today you’ll find out how Dorothy gets home, and you’ll finish your first novel of the year. That’s a big deal!

Today you will: 
•  Read the final chapters (19-24) — finish the book!
•  Identify the theme of the entire novel
•  Write a response about the ending

Time: About 55 minutes (it’s worth it!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The end of a book is when all the pieces come together. Everything the author has been building — the characters, the theme, the journey — reaches its conclusion. Savor it.

Think about this: Before you read, make one final prediction: How do you think Dorothy gets home?

🔍 What to look for:
•  How does Glinda help Dorothy?
•  What was the answer all along?
•  How do the friends say goodbye?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy and read Chapters 19 through 24 (the end of the book).

Some of these final chapters have adventures on the way to Glinda. The most important chapters are the last two, where Glinda reveals the secret of the silver shoes and Dorothy goes home.

💡 Reading tip: When you finish, sit with it for a moment. How do you feel? What sticks with you? That feeling IS the theme working on you.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
grateful  (adjective)
Feeling thankful and appreciating what you have, even if it’s simple.

From the story: When Dorothy clicks her silver shoes and lands in Kansas, she is grateful to be home — even though Kansas is still gray and flat.

Think about it: Why is Dorothy grateful for Kansas now, when she wasn’t at the beginning? What changed — Kansas, or Dorothy?
