UNIT 1  •  LESSON 16 OF 180
Meet Perseus
Greek Mythology  •  Perseus and Medusa

📚  Welcome!
New week, new kind of story! We’re leaving Oz behind and traveling back thousands of years to ancient Greece. The Greeks told stories about heroes, gods, and monsters — and their stories follow a pattern that might feel familiar.

Today you will: 
•  Read the myth of Perseus and Medusa
•  Meet a different kind of hero
•  Start comparing hero stories
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

📚 Where to find it: Your teacher will provide the Perseus myth, or you can find it in a public domain mythology collection.

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Think about Dorothy’s story: She leaves home, faces challenges, gets help from friends, defeats the villain, and returns home changed. That pattern — leaving, struggling, and returning — is called the Hero’s Journey. It shows up in stories from every culture.

Think about this: What makes someone a hero? Do they have to be strong, or can they be a hero in other ways?

🔍 What to look for:
•  Who is Perseus? What quest is he given?
•  Who helps him along the way?
•  How does his story follow the Hero’s Journey pattern?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the myth of Perseus and Medusa.

Perseus is a young man who is sent on a seemingly impossible quest: kill Medusa, a monster whose gaze turns people to stone. Watch for how he gets help, just like Dorothy did.

💡 Reading tip: Myths were told aloud for hundreds of years before anyone wrote them down. Read this one like someone is telling you an exciting story around a campfire.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
quest  (noun)
A long, difficult journey undertaken to achieve a goal. Heroes go on quests.

From the story: Perseus’s quest to defeat Medusa is full of danger, but he receives magical gifts from the gods to help him.

Think about it: How is a quest different from a regular trip? What makes Dorothy’s story a quest too?
