UNIT 1  •  LESSON 17 OF 180
Into the Labyrinth
Greek Mythology  •  Theseus and the Minotaur

📚  Welcome!
Yesterday you met Perseus. Today, meet Theseus — a hero who must enter a dark, twisting maze and face a terrifying monster called the Minotaur. No magic gifts this time. Just courage and cleverness.

Today you will: 
•  Read the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur
•  Identify the Hero’s Journey pattern
•  Compare three hero stories
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Hero’s Journey pattern: (1) The hero leaves home. (2) They face challenges. (3) They get help. (4) They defeat the villain. (5) They return home changed. Watch for this pattern in Theseus’s story.

Think about this: Imagine being sent into a dark maze with a monster at the center. What would you bring with you?

🔍 What to look for:
•  What is the Minotaur? Why does Theseus have to face it?
•  Who helps Theseus?
•  How does this follow the Hero’s Journey?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.

The Minotaur is a creature that is half man, half bull, trapped inside a maze called the Labyrinth. Young people are sent in as sacrifices. Theseus volunteers to go in and stop it.

💡 Reading tip: As you read, mentally check off each step of the Hero’s Journey. Can you find all five steps?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
labyrinth  (noun)
A complicated maze of paths and passages. Once you’re inside, it’s almost impossible to find your way out.

From the story: The Labyrinth was designed so that no one who entered could ever escape — but Theseus had a plan.

Think about it: Have you ever felt lost in a confusing situation, like you were in a labyrinth? What helped you find your way?
