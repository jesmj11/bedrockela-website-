UNIT 1  •  LESSON 18 OF 180
The Fastest Hero
Greek Mythology  •  Atalanta’s Race

📚  Welcome!
Not all Greek heroes are men with swords. Today you’ll meet Atalanta — a woman who was raised by bears, could outrun anyone alive, and refused to let anyone tell her what she couldn’t do.

Today you will: 
•  Read the myth of Atalanta
•  Think about how this hero is different from the others
•  Compare heroes across all four stories
•  Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
So far, Perseus and Theseus both follow the Hero’s Journey pretty closely. Does Atalanta? Watch for how her story is similar AND how it breaks the pattern.

Think about this: Have you ever been told you couldn’t do something because of who you are? How did you respond?

🔍 What to look for:
•  How is Atalanta different from the other heroes?
•  What is her greatest strength?
•  Does her story follow the Hero’s Journey, or is it different?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the myth of Atalanta.

Atalanta was abandoned as a baby and raised by bears. She grew up to be the fastest runner in all of Greece. When told she must marry, she set a condition: anyone who wanted to marry her had to beat her in a race. If they lost, they died.

💡 Reading tip: Think about what Atalanta’s story says about strength. Is she strong in the same way as Perseus and Theseus, or in a different way?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
determination  (noun)
The quality of being firm in your purpose. Not giving up, no matter what.

From the story: Atalanta’s determination made her unstoppable. No one could beat her because she refused to lose.

Think about it: Which of our heroes shows the most determination — Dorothy, Perseus, Theseus, or Atalanta? Why?
