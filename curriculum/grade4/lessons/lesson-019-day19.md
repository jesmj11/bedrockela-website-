UNIT 1  •  LESSON 19 OF 180
The Hero’s Journey Pattern
Comparing All Four Hero Stories

📚  Welcome!
No new reading today! Instead, you’re going to look at all four hero stories side by side and discover the pattern that connects them. Then — the exciting part — you’ll start planning your own hero story.

Today you will: 
•  Map the Hero’s Journey for all four heroes
•  Compare and contrast the stories
•  Begin planning YOUR hero’s journey narrative

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Hero’s Journey has these steps:
1. HOME — The hero starts in their ordinary world.
2. THE CALL — Something happens that sends them on a quest.
3. CHALLENGES — The hero faces obstacles and dangers.
4. HELP — The hero receives help from friends or gifts.
5. THE BIG TEST — The hero faces the hardest challenge.
6. VICTORY — The hero succeeds.
7. RETURN — The hero returns home, changed.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading today! Instead, look back at your notes and journal entries from the past 18 days. You’re going to fill in a Hero’s Journey chart for all four heroes.

💡 Tip: It’s okay to flip back through your book and your journal. Good readers and writers go back to check their thinking!

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
narrative  (noun)
A story. When you write a narrative, you’re telling a story with characters, a setting, a problem, and a solution.

From the story: Every hero story is a narrative — a tale with a beginning, middle, and end. Now you’re going to write your own narrative.

Think about it: You’ve been reading narratives for 18 days. Now it’s your turn to write one. What story do YOU want to tell?

4. Why do you think the Hero’s Journey pattern appears in stories from so many different cultures and time periods? What does it tell us about people?

✍️  Part 5: Plan Your Hero’s Journey Story!
It’s time to write YOUR OWN hero’s journey! Over the next few days, you’ll plan, draft, and finish a short story (1-2 pages) that follows the Hero’s Journey pattern.

Today is PLANNING DAY. Fill in your story mountain:

My Hero’s Name: [_______________]
1. HOME — Where does your hero start? What is their ordinary life like? [_______________]
2. THE CALL — What happens that sends them on a quest? [_______________]
3. CHALLENGES — What obstacles do they face? (At least 2) [_______________]
4. HELP — Who helps them? What gift or friendship do they receive? [_______________]
5. THE BIG TEST — What is the hardest challenge? [_______________]
6. VICTORY — How do they succeed? [_______________]
7. RETURN — How do they return home? How have they changed? [_______________]

💡 Your hero can be anyone or anything — a kid, an animal, a robot, a mythical creature. The story can take place anywhere. Just follow the Hero’s Journey pattern!

Tomorrow, you’ll start writing your story!
