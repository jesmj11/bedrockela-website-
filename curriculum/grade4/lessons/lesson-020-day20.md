UNIT 1  •  LESSON 20 OF 180
Writing Day: Your Hero Begins
Writing Workshop — Hero’s Journey Narrative Draft

📚  Welcome!
Today is all about writing. You planned your hero’s journey yesterday. Now it’s time to bring that plan to life. You’re going to write the FIRST HALF of your story today.

Today you will: 
•  Write the beginning and middle of your hero’s journey story
•  Focus on descriptive details and dialogue
•  Get at least one page written

Time: About 45-50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Before you start writing, let’s review some storytelling tools:

•  Start with ACTION or DIALOGUE — drop the reader right into the story.
•  Use DESCRIPTIVE DETAILS — help the reader see, hear, and feel the world.
•  Include DIALOGUE — let your characters talk! Put their words in quotation marks.
•  Follow your PLAN — your story mountain from yesterday is your roadmap.

Quick dialogue refresher:
“We have to cross that bridge,” said Maya, gripping her flashlight.
“But what about the troll?” whispered Leo.

Notice: quotation marks around the spoken words, comma before “said,” new paragraph for each speaker.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading today — today is a WRITING DAY!

Pull out your story plan from yesterday and start writing your narrative. Today, try to write through steps 1-4 of your Hero’s Journey:

1. HOME — Introduce your hero and their world (1-2 paragraphs)
2. THE CALL — Show what sends them on the quest (1 paragraph)
3. CHALLENGES — Describe the obstacles (1-2 paragraphs)
4. HELP — Introduce the friend or gift (1 paragraph)

💡 Don’t worry about being perfect. Just get the story flowing. You’ll revise later!

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
dialogue  (noun)
The words characters speak out loud in a story. Written inside quotation marks.

From the story: “I’m not afraid,” the hero said. (That’s dialogue!)

Think about it: Why does dialogue make a story more interesting than just describing everything? How does hearing a character’s actual words change how you experience the story?

✍️  Part 4: Write Your Hero’s Journey — First Half
Using your plan from yesterday, write the first half of your hero’s journey story. Try to include:

•  A strong opening that grabs the reader
•  Descriptive details about the setting
•  At least one line of dialogue
•  A clear challenge or problem the hero faces

Sentence starters if you need them:
•  “The last thing [hero] expected that morning was...”
•  “[Hero] had always known [their world] was [description], but today something felt different.”
•  “‘You have to help us,’ the stranger said. ‘You’re the only one who can.’”
