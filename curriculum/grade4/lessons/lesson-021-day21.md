UNIT 1  •  LESSON 21 OF 180
Writing Day: The Big Test and Victory
Writing Workshop — Hero’s Journey Narrative Draft (Part 2)

📚  Welcome!
Welcome to Week 5! Your hero is in the middle of their journey. Today, you’ll write the most exciting part — the Big Test and the Victory. This is where your hero faces their greatest challenge and overcomes it.

Today you will: 
•  Write the climax and ending of your hero’s journey story
•  Build suspense and excitement
•  Write the hero’s return home

Time: About 45-50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Yesterday you wrote through the challenges. Today you’re writing the CLIMAX — the most intense, exciting, highest-stakes moment in the story. Then you’ll wind it down with the return.

Tips for writing a great climax:
•  Slow down the action. Use short sentences to build tension.
•  Show what your hero is feeling INSIDE (heart racing, hands shaking).
•  Make us worry. The reader should think: “Will they make it?”
•  Then — the breakthrough moment. The hero succeeds!

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading today — another WRITING DAY!

Pick up where you left off yesterday and write through the end of your story:
5. THE BIG TEST — The hardest challenge. Make it dramatic! (1-2 paragraphs)
6. VICTORY — How the hero succeeds (1 paragraph)
7. RETURN — The hero comes home, changed (1 paragraph)

💡 Remember: the best endings show how the hero has CHANGED. Who are they now that they weren’t before?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
climax  (noun)
The most exciting, intense, highest point of a story. The moment when the biggest conflict is decided.

From the story: In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the climax is when Dorothy throws water on the Wicked Witch. Everything builds to that moment.

Think about it: What will the climax of YOUR story be? What’s the moment where everything is on the line?

✍️  Part 4: Write Your Hero’s Journey — Second Half
Write the second half of your story! This is where your hero faces the Big Test, wins, and returns home changed.

Suspense-building sentence starters:
•  “There was no turning back now.”
•  “[Hero’s] heart pounded. This was it.”
•  “For a moment, everything was still. Then...”

Ending sentence starters:
•  “As [hero] looked back at [place], they realized something had changed — not the world, but themselves.”
•  “Home looked the same. But [hero] didn’t.”
