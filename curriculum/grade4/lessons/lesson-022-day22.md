UNIT 1  •  LESSON 22 OF 180
Revision Day: Make It Shine
Writing Workshop — Revising Your Narrative

📚  Welcome!
You have a complete first draft! Amazing. But here’s the truth about writing: first drafts are never the best version. Today, you’re going to re-read your story and make it better. This is called REVISING.

Today you will: 
•  Re-read your hero’s journey story from start to finish
•  Revise for stronger details, clearer sentences, and better flow
•  Use a revision checklist

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Revising is NOT the same as fixing spelling mistakes. That comes later (editing). Revising is about making the STORY better:

•  Adding details that help the reader picture the scene
•  Cutting parts that are boring or don’t matter
•  Making dialogue sound more real
•  Making sure the story flows and makes sense

Professional authors revise MANY times. Today you’re doing what real writers do.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Re-read your ENTIRE hero’s journey story from start to finish. Read it slowly, like you’re reading it for the first time.

As you read, use the revision checklist below. For each item, ask: “Did I do this?” If not, fix it.

💡 Reading tip: Try reading your story out loud (or in your head but “hearing” it). You’ll catch things that sound awkward or confusing.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
revise  (verb)
To re-see your writing and make changes to improve it. Not just fixing mistakes, but making the whole piece stronger.

From the story: Even L. Frank Baum revised The Wonderful Wizard of Oz before it was published. Every great writer revises.

Think about it: Why is it hard to revise your own writing? What’s one trick that helps? (Hint: reading out loud!)

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. ✅ REVISION CHECKLIST — Go through each item and write YES or NEEDS WORK next to each:

2. Find your WEAKEST paragraph (the one you’re least happy with). What’s wrong with it? How could you make it better? Rewrite it below.
💡 Hint: Maybe it’s too short, or too vague, or confusing. Pick one thing to fix and rewrite it.

3. Find your STRONGEST paragraph (the one you’re most proud of). Why is it good? What makes it work?
💡 Hint: Knowing what you do WELL is just as important as knowing what to fix.
