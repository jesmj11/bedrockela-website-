UNIT 1  •  LESSON 23 OF 180
Editing and Final Draft
Writing Workshop — Editing & Publishing

📚  Welcome!
Your story is revised and strong. Today’s job is to polish it — fix spelling, punctuation, and grammar so it reads cleanly. Then you’ll write (or type) your final draft.

Today you will: 
•  Edit your story for spelling, grammar, and punctuation
•  Write your final, polished draft
•  Give your story a title

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Editing checklist — read through your story and fix:

✅  Every sentence starts with a capital letter
✅  Every sentence ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point
✅  Dialogue has quotation marks around the spoken words
✅  Character names are capitalized
✅  Spelling is correct (if you’re not sure about a word, look it up!)
✅  Paragraphs are indented

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read through your story one more time, slowly, focusing ONLY on conventions (spelling, grammar, punctuation). Then write your clean final draft.

💡 Editing trick: Read your story BACKWARDS, sentence by sentence. This forces you to look at each sentence on its own and catch errors you’d miss reading normally.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
publish  (verb)
To make your writing available for others to read. When you share your final draft, you are publishing it!

From the story: L. Frank Baum published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900. Today, you’re publishing YOUR hero’s journey!

Think about it: How does it feel to know that someone else will read your story? Does it change how carefully you write?

✍️  Part 4: Your Final Draft
Write (or type) your clean, polished, final hero’s journey story below. This is the version that will be shared!

Title: [_______________]
By: [Your Name]

[Your final story here]
