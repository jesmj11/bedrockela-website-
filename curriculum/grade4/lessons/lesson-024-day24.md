UNIT 1  •  LESSON 24 OF 180
Author’s Chair: Share Your Story
Sharing & Celebrating Our Writing

📚  Welcome!
Today is one of the best days of the year: Author’s Chair Day! You wrote a hero’s journey story from scratch — planned it, drafted it, revised it, edited it, and published it. Now it’s time to share it.

Today you will: 
•  Read your hero’s journey story (to a partner, group, or by recording yourself)
•  Listen to other stories and give kind feedback
•  Reflect on your growth as a writer

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
When you share your writing:
•  Read slowly and clearly.
•  Use expression — change your voice for dialogue!
•  Be proud. You MADE this.

When you listen to someone else’s story:
•  Listen respectfully.
•  Think of one specific thing you liked (“I loved the part where...”).
•  Think of one kind suggestion (“I wonder what would happen if...”).

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read your final draft aloud. If you’re working independently, record yourself reading it, or read it to a family member, friend, or pet. (Pets are great listeners.)

Then, if your teacher has shared other students’ stories, read at least one of them and leave a comment using the feedback format below.

💡 Sharing your writing takes courage. Remember the Cowardly Lion? Courage isn’t the absence of fear — it’s doing the thing even when you’re nervous.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
feedback  (noun)
Helpful comments about someone’s work. Good feedback is specific, kind, and useful.

From the story: When you give feedback on a story, focus on what worked AND what could be even better.

Think about it: What’s the difference between helpful feedback and just saying “it’s good”? Why is specific feedback more useful?

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. After reading or sharing your story, write a “STAR” (one thing you’re proud of) and a “WISH” (one thing you’d improve if you could write it again).

STAR: ___

WISH: ___
💡 Hint: Be specific! “I’m proud of my dialogue” is better than “it’s good.”
[Your answer]

2. If you read or listened to another student’s story, give them feedback:

“I liked the part where ___.”
“One thing that could make it even better is ___.”
💡 Hint: Be kind and specific. Writers work hard and deserve thoughtful responses.
[Your answer]


✍️  Your Reading Journal
Reflection journal (paragraph):

•  How did it feel to share your writing? What was nerve-wracking? What was exciting?
•  What did you learn about yourself as a writer during this project?
•  If you could write another hero’s journey, what would you do differently?

💡 Reminder: Look back at your very first journal entry from Day 1. Look how far you’ve come!
