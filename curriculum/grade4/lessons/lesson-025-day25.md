Unit 1 Celebration: How Far You’ve Come
Unit 1 Review & Celebration

📚  Welcome!
🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve completed the first quarter of your reading journey! Let’s look at everything you’ve accomplished.

In 25 days, you have:
•  Read an ENTIRE NOVEL (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz — 24 chapters!)
•  Read THREE Greek myths (Perseus, Theseus, Atalanta)
•  Written 20+ journal entries
•  Written and published your own hero’s journey story
•  Learned 20+ vocabulary words
•  Discovered the Hero’s Journey pattern that connects stories across cultures

Today you will: 
•  Take a final comprehension check on the unit
•  Write a text-evidence essay (your first!)
•  Celebrate!

Time: About 55 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Today’s assessment is not a test to trick you. It’s a chance to show what you know. You’ve been doing this work for 25 days — you’re ready.

The essay question at the end asks you to use evidence from TWO texts. That means you need to mention specific details from the books/myths you’ve read. You’ve been practicing this in your journal all month!

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading today. This is a review and assessment day. Use your memory, your journal, and your knowledge of the texts.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
evidence  (noun)
Specific details, facts, or examples from a text that support your point. When you say “In Chapter 15, the Wizard admits he’s a humbug,” that’s evidence.

From the story: Strong writing uses evidence from the text to prove its point. Don’t just say what you think — show WHY you think it.

Think about it: Why is evidence important? What’s the difference between an opinion with evidence and an opinion without it?

✍️  Part 5: Your First Text-Evidence Essay
