UNIT 1  •  LESSON 26 OF 180
Reflecting on Our Reading Journey
Unit 1 Wrap-Up • Looking Back at the Hero’s Journey

📚  Welcome!
Welcome to the final week of Unit 1! This week is about reflection, celebration, and getting ready for the next adventure. Today, you’ll look back at everything you’ve read and written.

Today you will: 
•  Review your reading journal from Day 1 to Day 25
•  Pick your favorite journal entry and explain why
•  Write a reflection on your growth

Time: About 40-45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Go back and re-read your journal entries from the beginning. Start with Day 1. Notice how your writing has changed. Your entries are longer, more detailed, and more thoughtful than when you started. That’s growth.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading today. Re-read your own writing — your journal entries from Days 1-25.

💡 Reading your own writing from a few weeks ago is one of the best ways to see how much you’ve improved.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
reflection  (noun)
The act of thinking carefully about your experiences and what you learned from them.

From the story: When you look back at your journal entries and think about how you’ve grown, that’s reflection.

Think about it: Why is reflection important? Can you improve at something if you never stop to think about how you’re doing?

✍️  Your Reading Journal
Growth reflection (write a full paragraph — 5-6 sentences):

•  Compare your Day 1 self to your Day 26 self as a reader and writer. What changed?
•  What was the hardest part of Unit 1? What was the most fun?
•  What are you most proud of from the last 25 days?

💡 Reminder: This is one of the most important journal entries you’ll write. Be honest and specific.
