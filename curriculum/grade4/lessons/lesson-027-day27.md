UNIT 1  •  LESSON 27 OF 180
Best Of Unit 1: Your Portfolio
Unit 1 Wrap-Up • Portfolio Day

📚  Welcome!
Today you’re building a portfolio — a collection of your BEST work from Unit 1. Think of it as a highlight reel of your reading and writing journey.

Today you will: 
•  Select your best journal entry
•  Select your favorite part of your hero’s journey story
•  Write a short introduction explaining your choices

Time: About 40-45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
A portfolio shows your best work. Professionals in every field — artists, writers, designers — keep portfolios. Today you’re making yours.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading. Review your work from Unit 1 and select your best pieces.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
portfolio  (noun)
A collection of your best work, chosen to show what you can do.

From the story: Artists keep portfolios. Writers keep portfolios. Now you have one too.

Think about it: Why is it important to choose your BEST work, not just all your work?
