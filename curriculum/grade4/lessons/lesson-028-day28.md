UNIT 1  •  LESSON 28 OF 180
Readers’ Theater: Oz Comes Alive!
Unit 1 Wrap-Up • Readers’ Theater Performance

📚  Welcome!
Time to bring Oz to life! Readers’ theater is when you read a scene from a book out loud with expression, acting out the characters’ voices. No costumes or memorization needed — just your voice and the text.

Today you will: 
•  Choose a favorite scene from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
•  Practice reading it with expression
•  Perform it (to yourself, a partner, or record it)

Time: About 40-45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Choose ONE scene from the book that you’d love to read aloud. Here are some great options:
•  Dorothy meets the Scarecrow (Chapter 3)
•  The Cowardly Lion appears (Chapter 6)
•  The Wizard is revealed as a humbug (Chapter 15)
•  Dorothy clicks her heels (final chapter)

Tips for reading with expression:
•  Give each character a different voice
•  Read dialogue with feeling — scared, excited, angry, sad
•  Slow down for dramatic moments. Speed up for action.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Find your chosen scene in your digital copy. Read through it once silently, marking where you’ll change your voice for different characters. Then read it aloud at least twice, improving your expression each time.

If possible, record yourself and listen back. You’ll be surprised how good you sound!

💡 Reading with expression helps you understand the text better. When you have to decide HOW a character sounds, you’re thinking deeply about who they are.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
expression  (noun)
The way you use your voice to show feelings and meaning when reading aloud. Changing your tone, speed, and volume to match the story.

From the story: When you read the Cowardly Lion’s lines with a shaky, nervous voice, that’s reading with expression.

Think about it: How does expression change the experience of hearing a story? Would Oz be as interesting if everything were read in a flat, boring voice?
