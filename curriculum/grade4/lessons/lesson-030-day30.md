UNIT 1  •  LESSON 30 OF 180
🎉 Unit 1 Complete: You Are a Reader!
Celebration & Looking Ahead

📚  Welcome!
🎉🎉🎉 DAY 30! You did it!

Let’s take a moment to appreciate what you’ve accomplished in 30 days:
•  Read an entire novel (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz — all 24 chapters)
•  Read 3 Greek myths (Perseus, Theseus, Atalanta)
•  Wrote 25+ reading journal entries
•  Planned, drafted, revised, edited, and published a hero’s journey narrative
•  Wrote your first text-evidence essay
•  Learned 28 vocabulary words
•  Discovered the Hero’s Journey pattern across cultures
•  Identified themes, analyzed characters, made predictions, and compared texts

That’s not “pretty good.” That’s AMAZING.

Today you will: 
•  Write a letter to yourself about your journey
•  Set goals for Unit 2
•  Get a sneak peek at what’s coming next!

Time: About 40 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Before you do anything else, close your eyes for 10 seconds and think about your favorite moment from the last 30 days. Was it a scene from the book? Something you wrote? A word you learned? A question that made you think? Hold onto that moment. That’s what reading does — it gives you moments that stay with you.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading assignment today. Today is about YOU and your growth.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
transformation  (noun)
A major change. When something or someone becomes something new and different.

From the story: Dorothy went through a transformation on her journey. She started as a scared girl and became a brave leader. You’ve been through a transformation too — in just 30 days.

Think about it: How have YOU been transformed as a reader and writer? What can you do now that you couldn’t do on Day 1?

✍️  Part 4: Letter to Yourself + Looking Ahead
Write a letter to yourself about Unit 1. Be honest, be proud, and be specific.

Dear Me,

Write about:
•  What I’m most proud of from Unit 1
•  The hardest thing I did and how I got through it
•  My favorite book/myth/story moment
•  How I’ve grown as a reader and writer
•  What I’m excited about for Unit 2

🔮 SNEAK PEEK: UNIT 2

Next up: Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. You’ll meet Jim Hawkins, a boy who discovers a pirate’s treasure map and sets sail on a dangerous voyage. There will be mutiny, a one-legged pirate named Long John Silver, and a mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end.

If The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was about finding what’s inside you, Treasure Island is about figuring out who to trust when everyone might be lying.

Get ready. The adventure continues in Lesson 31. ⚓
