UNIT 2  •  LESSON 31 OF 180
A New Voice, A New Adventure
Treasure Island • Chapters 1-2

📚  Welcome!
Welcome to Unit 2! You just finished a story told by a narrator OUTSIDE the story (third person). Now you’re about to read a story told by someone INSIDE it. Meet Jim Hawkins — he’s going to tell you his story himself.

Treasure Island is darker, grittier, and more suspenseful than Oz. There are pirates, treasure maps, double-crossings, and danger around every corner.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 1-2 of Treasure Island
• Learn the difference between 1st and 3rd person point of view
• Meet Jim Hawkins and notice how HIS voice tells the story
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a narrator told us Dorothy’s story from the outside. That’s called THIRD PERSON — the narrator uses “she,” “he,” “they.”

In Treasure Island, Jim Hawkins tells his OWN story using “I” and “me.” That’s FIRST PERSON. You can only know what Jim knows, see what Jim sees, feel what Jim feels.

Think about this: What’s the difference between someone telling you about a scary experience vs. hearing it from the person who lived it?

🔍 What to look for:
• Find sentences where Jim uses “I” — this is first person
• What do we learn about Jim from the way he tells his story?
• Who is Billy Bones? What makes him frightening?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy of Treasure Island and read Chapters 1-2: “The Old Sea-Dog at the Admiral Benbow” and “Black Dog Appears and Disappears.”

This book was written in 1883, so the language is older than Oz. Some words will feel unfamiliar. Use context clues and keep going — it gets easier.

💡 Reading tip: Pay attention to Jim’s VOICE. How does he sound? Nervous? Brave? Curious? In first person, the narrator’s personality comes through in every sentence.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
rogue  (noun)
A dishonest or unprincipled person. Someone who can’t be trusted and may cause trouble.

From the story: Billy Bones is clearly a rogue — he drinks too much, scares the guests, and is hiding from someone dangerous.

Think about it: Is a rogue the same as a villain? Can someone be a rogue but still be interesting or even likeable?
