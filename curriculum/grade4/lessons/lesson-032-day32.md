UNIT 2  •  LESSON 32 OF 180
The Black Spot
Treasure Island • Chapters 3-4

📚  Welcome!
Billy Bones is hiding from someone. Today, that someone finds him — and what follows is one of the most suspenseful openings in adventure literature. Two chapters today!

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 3-4 of Treasure Island
• Notice how 1st person POV creates suspense
• Track what Jim can see vs. what he can’t
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
In first person, suspense works differently. Jim doesn’t know what’s coming — and since he’s telling the story, WE don’t know either. We’re trapped in his perspective.

Think about this: What’s scarier — watching a horror movie where you can see the monster sneaking up, or being the character who DOESN’T know it’s there?

🔍 What to look for:
• What is the Black Spot? What does it mean?
• What happens to Billy Bones?
• What does Jim find in the sea chest?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 3: “The Black Spot” and Chapter 4: “The Sea Chest.”

Blind Pew arrives, Billy Bones receives the Black Spot, and Jim makes a decision that changes everything.

💡 Reading tip: When the action gets intense, slow down instead of speeding up. The details matter in suspenseful scenes.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
dreadful  (adjective)
Causing great fear or suffering. Extremely bad or frightening.

From the story: Jim describes the blind beggar as dreadful — the sound of his tapping stick fills Jim with terror.

Think about it: Why is a blind beggar more frightening than a big muscular pirate here? What makes the UNKNOWN scarier than the KNOWN?
