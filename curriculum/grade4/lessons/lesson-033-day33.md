UNIT 2  •  LESSON 33 OF 180
The Treasure Map
Treasure Island • Chapters 5-6

📚  Welcome!
Jim has the map. What does he do with it? Today, the adults get involved, a voyage is planned, and we meet new characters — including one you should NOT trust.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 5-6 of Treasure Island
• Meet Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney
• Think about what Jim can and can’t know as narrator
• Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
First-person narrators can only tell you what THEY know. Jim can’t read other people’s minds. This means Jim — and the reader — can be fooled.

Think about this: If someone seems friendly but is secretly plotting against you, how would you know? What clues might you miss?

🔍 What to look for:
• Who decides to go after the treasure?
• What kind of people are Dr. Livesey and the Squire?
• Does anyone mention hiring a crew? (This will matter later.)

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 5-6. Plans are made and the voyage takes shape.

💡 Reading tip: Start noticing what Jim notices and what he DOESN’T notice. A first-person narrator can’t see their own blind spots.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
countenance  (noun)
A person’s face or facial expression. What their face reveals about how they’re feeling.

From the story: Jim describes the Squire’s excited countenance when he sees the map — the man can barely contain himself.

Think about it: What can you tell about a person from their countenance? Can someone’s face lie?

[Your answer]

4. As a first-person narrator, Jim can only share what he sees and hears. What DOESN’T he know yet? What gaps does his perspective create?
💡 Hint: Jim trusts the adults to hire a good crew. Should he?
[Your answer]


✍️  Your Reading Journal
Today’s journal entry (paragraph):
