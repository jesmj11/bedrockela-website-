UNIT 2  •  LESSON 34 OF 180
Meet Long John Silver
Treasure Island • Chapters 7-8

📚  Welcome!
Today you meet Long John Silver. He’s charming, likeable, funny, and helpful. He’s also one of the most dangerous characters in all of literature. You WILL like him. The question is whether you should.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 7-8 of Treasure Island
• Meet Long John Silver and think about how Jim perceives him
• Consider what Jim CAN’T see about Silver
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Here’s the thing about first-person: Jim can only judge people by what they SHOW him. If someone is smart enough to hide who they really are, Jim and the reader will be fooled.

Think about this: Have you ever met someone who seemed really nice at first, but later you realized they weren’t what they appeared?

🔍 What to look for:
• How does Jim describe Silver? What words does he use?
• Does Silver seem trustworthy? What makes Jim think so?
• Are there any small clues that something might be off?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 7-8. Jim arrives in Bristol, boards the ship, and meets the cook: Long John Silver.

Try to hold two thoughts at once: (1) Jim likes Silver. (2) Should he?

💡 Reading tip: When a character is described as almost TOO good, too friendly, too helpful — be suspicious. Great authors use this to set up a betrayal.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
cunning  (adjective)
Clever in a sneaky, deceptive way. Someone who uses their intelligence to trick or manipulate others.

From the story: Long John Silver is cunning — he knows exactly what to say to make people trust him.

Think about it: What’s the difference between being smart and being cunning? Can someone be both?
