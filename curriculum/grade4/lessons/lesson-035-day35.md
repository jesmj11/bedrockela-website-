UNIT 2  •  LESSON 35 OF 180
Setting Sail
Treasure Island • Chapters 9-10

📚  Welcome!
The Hispaniola sets sail! Jim is at sea for the first time, surrounded by sailors he doesn’t know. The ship becomes its own world — a floating setting with its own rules.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 9-10 of Treasure Island
• Analyze the ship as a setting
• Track relationships between characters
• Write your end-of-week journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
In Wizard of Oz, the setting changed constantly. In Treasure Island, everyone is now stuck on a ship. Nobody can leave. That changes the tension completely.

Think about this: What makes being trapped in a small space with people you don’t fully trust especially tense?

🔍 What to look for:
• How does Jim describe life on the ship?
• Who does Captain Smollett trust? Who doesn’t he?
• Are there tensions between crew and officers?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 9-10. The ship is at sea. Captain Smollett is suspicious about something.

💡 Reading tip: A ship is a closed setting — no one can enter or leave. This makes it a pressure cooker for conflict. Authors LOVE closed settings.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
mutiny  (noun)
An open rebellion against the people in charge, especially by sailors against their officers.

From the story: Captain Smollett senses something is wrong with the crew. If the sailors rebel, it would be a mutiny.

Think about it: Why is a mutiny on a ship especially dangerous? Where would you go when you’re in the middle of the ocean?

2. Why is a ship an effective setting for building suspense?

3. Captain Smollett is worried, Silver is cheerful, Jim is excited. How does Jim’s first-person perspective limit what we understand?

4. Compare the ship to the Yellow Brick Road as settings. How does each affect the story’s mood and tension?
