UNIT 2  •  LESSON 36 OF 180
The Apple Barrel
Treasure Island • Chapter 11

📚  Welcome!
This is it. The chapter that changes the entire story. Jim climbs into an apple barrel for a snack — and overhears something he was never meant to hear.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 11 — the apple barrel scene
• Experience dramatic irony (when the reader knows something characters don’t)
• Analyze how POV makes this scene powerful
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
When a character discovers a secret that changes how they see everyone, it’s a turning point. Jim is trapped on a ship with the very people he now fears.

Think about this: Imagine finding out someone you liked and trusted was lying the whole time. How would that feel?

🔍 What to look for:
• What does Jim overhear Silver saying?
• How does this change Jim’s feelings about Silver?
• What is “dramatic irony” and how does this scene create it?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 11: “What I Heard in the Apple Barrel.” Read it slowly. This is the chapter everyone remembers.

Jim hides in the barrel and hears Silver talking to the crew. What Silver says reveals his true nature.

💡 Key term: DRAMATIC IRONY is when the reader (or a character) knows something that other characters don’t. After this chapter, Jim knows Silver’s secret — but Silver doesn’t know Jim knows. That creates incredible tension.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
treachery  (noun)
Betrayal of trust. When someone you believed was on your side turns out to be working against you.

From the story: Silver’s treachery is revealed in the apple barrel. The friendly cook was plotting mutiny all along.

Think about it: Is treachery worse than simple cruelty? Why does betrayal by someone you trusted hurt more than harm from a stranger?
