UNIT 2  •  LESSON 37 OF 180
The Secret Weighs Heavy
Treasure Island • Chapter 12

📚  Welcome!
Jim knows Silver’s secret. Now he has to tell the people he trusts without Silver finding out. This chapter is about trust, strategy, and the weight of dangerous knowledge.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 12 of Treasure Island
• Analyze Jim’s decision-making
• Write your FIRST POV REWRITE

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Jim has information that could save or doom everyone. How he handles it reveals his character.

Think about this: If you overheard a dangerous secret, who would you tell? How would you decide who to trust?

🔍 What to look for:
• How does Jim share what he heard?
• How do the captain, doctor, and squire react?
• What plan do they make?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 12: “Council of War.” Jim tells his allies what Silver said. The good guys make a plan.

💡 Reading tip: Notice how the mood shifts from Chapter 11’s panic to Chapter 12’s controlled tension. Good authors vary the pace.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
allegiance  (noun)
Loyalty or commitment to a leader, group, or cause. Whose side you’re on.

From the story: Jim’s allegiance is to the captain and doctor. Silver’s crew has secretly given their allegiance to Silver.

Think about it: How do you decide where your allegiance lies? Is it always obvious who deserves your loyalty?
