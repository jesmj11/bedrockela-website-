UNIT 2  •  LESSON 38 OF 180
Land Ho!
Treasure Island • Chapters 13-14

📚  Welcome!
The island is in sight. Both sides know what’s coming. The tension is about to break. And Jim makes a wild decision nobody expects.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 13-14 of Treasure Island
• Analyze rising action building toward climax
• Evaluate Jim’s decision-making
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Remember the story mountain? The rising action is when events get more intense, building toward the climax. We’re nearing the top.

Think about this: Have you ever acted on impulse — done something without thinking? Was it brave or reckless?

🔍 What to look for:
• What does Jim do that surprises everyone?
• How does the mood shift once the crew goes ashore?
• What violence does Jim witness?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 13-14. Jim sneaks ashore with the pirates. He witnesses something terrible, and the island adventure begins.

💡 Reading tip: Track the rising action. Each chapter should feel more tense than the last.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
reckless  (adjective)
Acting without thinking about danger or consequences. Bold but potentially foolish.

From the story: Jim’s decision to sneak ashore could be called reckless — it puts him in danger, but gives him information no one else has.

Think about it: Is there a difference between bravery and recklessness? Can the same action be both?
