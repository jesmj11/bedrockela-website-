UNIT 2  •  LESSON 39 OF 180
The Man of the Island
Treasure Island • Chapters 15-16

📚  Welcome!
Jim finds Ben Gunn, a marooned sailor who’s been alone for years. And then something interesting happens with the narration — pay close attention!

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 15-16
• Meet Ben Gunn
• Notice a SHIFT in the narrator
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Something unusual happens in Chapter 16: the narration switches! Jim stops telling the story, and Dr. Livesey takes over. Why would the author do this?

Think about this: If Jim isn’t there to see something important, how can a first-person novel show it?

🔍 What to look for:
• Who is Ben Gunn and how did he end up alone?
• When does the narrator switch? How can you tell?
• What does Dr. Livesey’s voice sound like compared to Jim’s?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 15-16. Chapter 15 is Jim’s narration. Chapter 16 switches to Dr. Livesey.

💡 Reading tip: When the narrator switches, the VOICE changes. Dr. Livesey is educated. Jim is a young boy. They notice different things, use different words, and have different tones.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
marooned  (verb/adjective)
Left alone in a remote place with no way to escape. Pirates would maroon people on islands as punishment.

From the story: Ben Gunn was marooned on Treasure Island three years ago by his crewmates.

Think about it: What would it be like to be marooned for three years? How would it change you?
