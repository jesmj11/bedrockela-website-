UNIT 2  •  LESSON 40 OF 180
Battle Lines
Treasure Island • Chapters 17-18

📚  Welcome!
The battle for Treasure Island has begun. Pirates vs. the captain’s group. Today’s chapters are action-packed, and the narrator switches back to Jim at a critical moment.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 17-18
• Track rising action toward climax
• Notice when Jim resumes narrating
• Write your end-of-week journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The doctor has been narrating, but Jim will take over again. When the POV shifts back, notice how the mood and energy change.

Think about this: In a battle, what’s scarier — watching from a safe distance or being right in the middle?

🔍 What to look for:
• What happens at the stockade?
• When does Jim’s narration resume?
• How close to the climax are we?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 17-18. The fighting begins. People get hurt.

💡 Reading tip: In action scenes, authors use SHORT SENTENCES to increase pace. Long sentences slow things down. Watch for this technique.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
siege  (noun)
When one group surrounds another, trying to force surrender by cutting off supplies and escape.

From the story: The pirates lay siege to the stockade, surrounding it and attacking.

Think about it: A siege is about patience and pressure. How is this different from a direct attack?
