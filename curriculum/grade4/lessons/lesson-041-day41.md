UNIT 2  •  LESSON 41 OF 180
Silver’s Embassy
Treasure Island • Chapters 19-20

📚  Welcome!
Silver walks up to the stockade under a flag of truce. He wants to negotiate. But can you negotiate with someone plotting to kill you?

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 19-20
• Analyze Silver’s manipulation
• Watch Jim make another daring decision
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Silver is the master of wearing masks. He can be a friendly cook, a ruthless leader, and a smooth negotiator — all in the same day.

Think about this: When someone changes how they act depending on their audience, is that smart or dishonest?

🔍 What to look for:
• How does Silver behave during the negotiation?
• What decision does Jim make at the end of Chapter 20?
• How is Jim growing as a character?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 19-20. Silver negotiates. The captain refuses. Then Jim does something nobody expected.

💡 Reading tip: Watch Silver’s language during the negotiation. He sounds reasonable. But remember the apple barrel. The polite mask makes the true Silver even more frightening.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
parley  (noun/verb)
A discussion between enemies, usually under a truce.

From the story: Silver comes to parley with the captain under a white flag. But a parley with Silver is dangerous — every word is calculated.

Think about it: Why would enemies agree to a parley? What advantage does talking give you?

3. Silver is polite during the parley, but we know from the apple barrel he’s plotting murder. How does DRAMATIC IRONY make this scene more tense?

[Your answer]

4. Jim keeps making impulsive decisions. Is he becoming a leader or just reckless? Use evidence from at least two chapters.
