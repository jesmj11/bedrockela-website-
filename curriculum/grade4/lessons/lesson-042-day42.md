UNIT 2  •  LESSON 42 OF 180
Jim’s Boldest Move
Treasure Island • Chapters 21-24

📚  Welcome!
Jim is out on his own. No adults, no plan, no backup. What happens next is some of the most exciting first-person narration in literature.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 21-24 (Jim’s sea adventure arc)
• Experience the climax of Jim’s solo mission
• Debate: hero or reckless kid?
• Write in your journal

Time: About 55 minutes (longer reading — worth it!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
These chapters are pure first-person adventure. Jim is alone, and everything is filtered through his eyes, fear, and determination.

Think about this: What’s the bravest thing you’ve ever done completely alone?

🔍 What to look for:
• What does Jim do with Ben Gunn’s boat?
• What happens when Jim boards the Hispaniola?
• Who does Jim encounter on the ship?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 21-24. Jim paddles out, climbs aboard the ship, and faces a life-threatening situation. The action is nonstop.

💡 Reading tip: These chapters are PEAK first-person. Notice how you feel Jim’s physical sensations — the rocking boat, cold water, exhaustion. First person puts you IN his body.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
perilous  (adjective)
Full of danger. Extremely risky with a high chance of harm.

From the story: Jim’s solo voyage in the tiny boat is perilous — one wrong wave could drown him.

Think about it: What makes a situation perilous vs. just scary?
