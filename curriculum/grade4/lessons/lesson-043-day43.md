UNIT 2  •  LESSON 43 OF 180
In the Enemy’s Camp
Treasure Island • Chapters 25-28

📚  Welcome!
Jim walks into Silver’s camp. He’s a prisoner among pirates. Silver must decide: is Jim more useful alive or dead?

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 25-28
• Analyze Silver as a complex character
• Write an extended POV rewrite

Time: About 55 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Silver is a villain who’s not pure evil. He protects Jim at times. He’s smart, adaptable, charming. The best villains aren’t one-dimensional.

Think about this: Can a villain be likeable? Can someone who does bad things also do good things?

🔍 What to look for:
• How does Silver treat Jim among the pirates?
• Does Silver protect Jim? Why might he?
• What is Silver’s plan now?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 25-28. Jim is Silver’s prisoner, but the relationship is more complicated than captor and captive.

💡 Reading tip: Complex characters have MIXED motivations. Silver isn’t protecting Jim out of pure kindness — he’s calculating. But he might also genuinely like the boy. Both can be true.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
complex  (adjective)
Made up of many connected parts. A complex character has multiple, sometimes contradictory traits.

From the story: Silver is the most complex character: murderer AND protector, liar AND man of his word, villain AND someone you can’t help admiring.

Think about it: Why are complex characters more interesting than simple ones?

4. Compare Silver to the Wicked Witch from Wizard of Oz. Which villain is more interesting? Which is more realistic?

[Your answer]


✍️  Extended POV Rewrite — Silver’s Dilemma
Write a FULL PAGE from Silver’s perspective during the chapters when Jim is his prisoner.

Include:
• Silver’s thoughts about Jim (does he like the boy? Is Jim useful? Both?)
• Silver’s feelings about the other pirates (does he trust his own crew?)
• Silver’s plan (what is he really trying to accomplish?)
• At least one line of internal conflict (Silver debating with himself)

Silver uses “I” like Jim does, but his VOICE is completely different. Make him sound like Silver, not Jim.
