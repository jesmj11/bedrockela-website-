UNIT 2  •  LESSON 44 OF 180
The Treasure Hunt
Treasure Island • Chapters 29-32

📚  Welcome!
The moment everyone has waited for: the treasure hunt. Silver, Jim, and the pirates go looking for Captain Flint’s treasure. What they find is NOT what they expected. This is the CLIMAX.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 29-32 — the climax
• Analyze the resolution
• Write in your journal

Time: About 55 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The CLIMAX is the highest point of tension. In Oz, it was the Wizard’s reveal. In Treasure Island, it’s the treasure hunt.

Think about this: What if you went on a dangerous journey for treasure and it wasn’t where you expected?

🔍 What to look for:
• What happens at the treasure spot?
• How do the pirates react?
• Who saves the day?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 29-32. The treasure hunt, the crisis, and the resolution.

💡 Reading tip: The climax should feel like the peak of a roller coaster. After this, the story winds down. Notice the shift.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
climax (revisited)  (noun)
The turning point and most intense moment of a story. You learned this in Unit 1 — now experience it in a different story.

From the story: The climax of Treasure Island is the treasure hunt itself — all the tension reaches its peak.

Think about it: How is this climax different from Wizard of Oz’s? What makes each satisfying?

4. How does Ben Gunn’s role in the climax change how you see him? Was Stevenson planting clues earlier?
