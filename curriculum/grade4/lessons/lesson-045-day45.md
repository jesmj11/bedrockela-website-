UNIT 2  •  LESSON 45 OF 180
The Voyage Home
Treasure Island • Chapters 33-34 (Conclusion)

📚  Welcome!
The last two chapters. The treasure is secured. The pirates are defeated. Time for the voyage home — and for saying goodbye to one of literature’s most complicated characters.

Today you will: 
• Read the final chapters of Treasure Island
• Reflect on Jim’s complete character arc
• Think about what happens to Silver
• Write a reflective journal about the whole novel

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Two big questions: (1) How has Jim changed from Chapter 1? (2) What happens to Silver — and does he get what he deserves?

Think about this: Does every villain deserve punishment? Is Silver’s story more complicated than that?

🔍 What to look for:
• What does Silver do at the end?
• How does Jim describe his feelings about the adventure?
• Does Jim seem like the same person as Chapter 1?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 33-34 — the conclusion. Pay attention to the final paragraphs. Jim’s last words reveal how the journey changed him.

💡 Reading tip: Great endings echo the beginning. Compare the first page to the last page.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
transformation (revisited)  (noun)
You learned this on Day 30. Jim has been transformed by his journey. But his transformation is darker and more complicated than Dorothy’s.

From the story: Jim’s transformation is not purely joyful. He’s gained courage and experience, but also seen violence and betrayal that will stay with him.

Think about it: How is Jim’s transformation different from Dorothy’s? Dorothy went home happy. Jim went home changed in a more complicated way.
