📚  Welcome!
Welcome to a new story from an ancient world! Sinbad the Sailor is one of the oldest adventure stories ever told — and like Treasure Island, it is in first person.

Today you will: 
• Read Sinbad the Sailor — First Voyage
• Compare Sinbad to Jim Hawkins as narrators
• Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Sinbad and Jim both tell stories in first person. But they come from different cultures and time periods. Watch for how the VOICE differs even though the POV is the same.

Think about this: Do adventure stories from ancient Baghdad sound different from 1800s England?

What to look for:
• How does Sinbad describe himself?
• What dangers does he face?
• How does the tone differ from Treasure Island?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the First Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor from a public domain Arabian Nights collection.

Sinbad is a merchant from Baghdad who cannot resist the call of the sea.

Reading tip: Both Jim and Sinbad use I — but they sound completely different. Jim is young and anxious. Sinbad is older and almost boastful. Same POV, different VOICE.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
merchant  (noun)
A person who buys and sells goods, especially one who trades with other countries.

From the story: Sinbad is a wealthy merchant from Baghdad who trades goods across the seas.
