UNIT 2  •  LESSON 47 OF 180
The Roc and the Valley
Arabian Nights • Sinbad: Second Voyage

📚  Welcome!
Sinbad’s Second Voyage features one of the most famous scenes in mythology: the Roc, a bird so enormous it blocks out the sun. Today’s reading is pure imagination.

Today you will: 
• Read Sinbad’s Second Voyage
• Compare adventure patterns across cultures
• Write a comparison journal entry

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Both Treasure Island and Sinbad are adventure stories. But the KIND of adventures are different. Jim faces human villains in a realistic world. Sinbad faces magical creatures in a fantastical world. Same genre, different style.

Think about this: Which is more exciting — realistic danger (pirates, mutiny) or fantastical danger (giant birds, sea monsters)?

What to look for:
• What is the Roc? How does Sinbad encounter it?
• How does Sinbad escape danger?
• Compare Sinbad’s resourcefulness to Jim’s

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Sinbad’s Second Voyage. This one involves the legendary Roc bird and a valley of diamonds.

Sinbad’s stories were originally told ALOUD in marketplaces and courts. Read this like someone performing for an audience.

Reading tip: The style is meant to amaze and entertain. Let yourself be swept up in the storytelling.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
resourceful  (adjective)
Able to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties. Good at solving problems with whatever is available.

From the story: Sinbad is incredibly resourceful — when stranded near a giant bird, he ties himself to its leg and rides it to safety.

Think about it: Both Jim and Sinbad are resourceful. How does each show this quality differently?
