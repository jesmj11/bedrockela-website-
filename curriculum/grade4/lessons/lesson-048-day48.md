UNIT 2  •  LESSON 48 OF 180
Real Pirates vs. Fiction
Nonfiction • The Real Pirates of History

📚  Welcome!
Time for a reality check. You’ve been reading about fictional pirates. Today you’ll learn about REAL ones — and you might be surprised by the differences.

Today you will: 
• Read nonfiction about real pirates (Blackbeard, golden age of piracy)
• Compare fiction to nonfiction
• Analyze author’s purpose
• Write your first informational paragraph of Unit 2

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Fiction writers create pirates to tell exciting stories. Nonfiction writers describe real pirates to share facts. The SAME topic looks very different depending on the author’s purpose.

Think about this: Do you think real pirates were like Long John Silver? What might be different?

What to look for:
• How were real pirates different from Stevenson’s pirates?
• How is nonfiction structured differently from fiction?
• What is the author’s PURPOSE in each type of text?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the nonfiction selection about real pirates provided by your teacher. This might cover Blackbeard, pirate codes, or life at sea.

Reading tip: Nonfiction is organized differently from fiction. Look for headings, facts, dates, and cause-and-effect. The goal is to inform, not to tell a story.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
brigantine  (noun)
A type of two-masted sailing ship commonly used by pirates and merchants in the 17th-18th centuries.

From the story: Real pirates often sailed brigantines — fast ships perfect for chasing down merchant vessels.

Think about it: Why would pirates need fast ships? How does knowing about real ships help you picture Treasure Island?
