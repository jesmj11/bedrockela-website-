UNIT 2  •  LESSON 49 OF 180
Pirate Myths vs. Pirate Facts
Nonfiction • Pirate History (continued)

📚  Welcome!
Did pirates really make people walk the plank? Did they bury treasure? Did they have parrots? Today you’ll separate pirate myths from pirate facts.

Today you will: 
• Continue exploring real pirate history
• Identify myths vs. facts
• Think about how fiction shapes understanding of history
• Write in your journal

Time: About 45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Stevenson’s Treasure Island was so popular that it CREATED many pirate stereotypes we still believe. Long John Silver with a parrot, buried treasure, treasure maps — more fiction than fact.

Think about this: Can a fictional book change what people believe about real history?

What to look for:
• Which pirate facts are actually fiction?
• What was real pirate life actually like?
• How did Treasure Island influence our image of pirates?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Continue with your nonfiction pirate materials. Focus on separating what’s real from what Stevenson invented.

Reading tip: When nonfiction contradicts what you knew from fiction, that shows how powerful stories are at shaping beliefs. Good readers question what they think they know.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
myth (new meaning)  (noun)
In this context, a widely believed but FALSE idea. A common misconception.

From the story: It is a myth that pirates always buried their treasure. In reality, most spent their loot quickly.

Think about it: What other facts do you believe that might actually be myths created by fiction?
