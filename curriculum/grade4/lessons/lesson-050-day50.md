UNIT 2  •  LESSON 50 OF 180
Halfway There!
Unit 2 Review • Day 50 of 180

📚  Welcome!
🎉 DAY 50! You are more than a quarter of the way through the year!

In 50 days, you have:
• Read TWO complete novels (Wizard of Oz + Treasure Island)
• Read Greek myths, Sinbad the Sailor, and nonfiction about real pirates
• Written 45+ journal entries
• Written a hero’s journey narrative and multiple POV rewrites
• Mastered 1st person vs. 3rd person POV
• Learned 45+ vocabulary words

Today you will: 
• Review key skills from Units 1-2
• Begin planning your adventure narrative
• Celebrate!

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Before planning your story, review the tools you have collected:

• From Unit 1: Story mountain, hero’s journey, descriptive details, dialogue, theme
• From Unit 2: First-person POV, voice, dramatic irony, suspense, complex characters, pacing

These are your storytelling TOOLS. Today you will use them to plan your own adventure.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading today! This is a planning and celebration day.

Look back through your journal and POV rewrites. You have already practiced writing in first person as Silver. Now you will create your OWN first-person narrator.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
narrator  (noun)
The voice that tells a story. In first person, the narrator is a character inside the story.

From the story: You have experienced Jim Hawkins (young, scared, brave) and Sinbad (older, confident, boastful). Now you will CREATE your own narrator.

Think about it: What kind of narrator will YOUR adventure story have?

✍️  Plan Your 1st-Person Adventure Narrative!
Over the next 5 days, you will write a 1st-person adventure story (1.5-2 pages). Today is PLANNING DAY.

Your story must include:
• A first-person narrator with a DISTINCT VOICE
• A clear story mountain (rising action, climax, resolution)
• Descriptive details and at least 2 lines of dialogue
• A moment of suspense or dramatic irony

Plan your story:
My narrator’s name: [___]
My narrator’s personality (3 words): [___]
Setting: [___]
The adventure/problem: [___]
Rising action (at least 2 challenges): [___]
Climax (the most intense moment): [___]
Resolution (how it ends): [___]
Moment of suspense or dramatic irony: [___]

Your narrator can be anyone — a kid, a sailor, an explorer, a time traveler. Just make it an ADVENTURE in FIRST PERSON with a voice that sounds like a real person.
