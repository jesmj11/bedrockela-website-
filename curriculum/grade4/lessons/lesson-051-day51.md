UNIT 2  •  LESSON 51 OF 180
Writing Day: Your Adventure Begins
Writing Workshop — Adventure Narrative Draft (Part 1)

📚  Welcome!
Time to write! You planned your adventure yesterday. Now bring it to life. Write the FIRST HALF today: the opening and rising action.

Today you will: 
• Write the beginning and middle of your 1st-person adventure
• Establish your narrator’s voice
• Build suspense

Time: About 45-50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
First-person voice tips:
• Your narrator should sound like a PERSON, not a report. Give them personality.
• Let them react: surprise, fear, excitement, humor.
• Use thoughts: I could not believe what I was seeing.
• Use senses: The salt spray stung my face.

Suspense tips:
• Short sentences for tense moments.
• End sections with unanswered questions.
• Show the narrator’s fear or uncertainty.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading today — WRITING DAY!

Pull out your story plan and start writing. Cover your opening and rising action (about 1 page).

Do not worry about perfection. Get the story flowing. You will revise later!

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
voice (literary term)  (noun)
The unique personality and style of a narrator. What makes one first-person narrator sound different from another.

From the story: Jim has a nervous, honest voice. Sinbad has a grand, storytelling voice. Your narrator needs THEIR OWN voice.

Think about it: Read your first paragraph aloud. Does your narrator sound like a real person or generic?

✍️  Write Your Adventure — First Half
Using your plan, write the opening and rising action. Aim for about 1 page.

Checklist for today:
✅ My narrator uses I and has a distinct personality
✅ The setting is described with sensory details
✅ At least one line of dialogue
✅ The reader can feel tension building

Sentence starters if needed:
I never should have [action]. But something pulled me forward.
The moment I saw [thing], I knew this was going to be different.
Are you sure about this? [friend] asked. I was not. But I nodded anyway.
