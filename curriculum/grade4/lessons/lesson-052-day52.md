UNIT 2  •  LESSON 52 OF 180
Writing Day: The Climax
Writing Workshop — Adventure Narrative Draft (Part 2)

📚  Welcome!
Yesterday you set the stage. Today, write the CLIMAX and the ending. This is the most exciting part — where everything comes to a head.

Today you will: 
• Write the climax and resolution
• Use pacing techniques (short sentences for action)
• Show how your narrator has changed

Time: About 45-50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Climax writing tips:
• Slow down the most intense moment. Use short, punchy sentences.
• Show physical reactions: My hands shook. My breath came in gasps.
• Make the reader worry: will the narrator succeed?

Ending tips:
• Show how the narrator has changed.
• Echo something from the beginning.
• The last line should stick with the reader.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading — WRITING DAY!

Pick up where you left off. Write the climax and resolution (about 0.5-1 page).

Remember Jim’s ending: he went home changed but haunted. Your narrator should be different at the end than at the beginning.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
pacing  (noun)
The speed at which a story moves. Fast pacing uses short sentences and quick action. Slow pacing uses long descriptions and reflection.

From the story: During the climax, speed up with short sentences. During reflection, slow down.

Think about it: Look at your climax. Are your sentences short and punchy, or long and slow?
