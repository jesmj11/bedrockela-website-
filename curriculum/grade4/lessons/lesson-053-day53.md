UNIT 2  •  LESSON 53 OF 180
Revision: Strengthen Your Voice
Writing Workshop — Revision

📚  Welcome!
Your first draft is done! Today, re-read it and make it BETTER. Focus on your narrator’s voice and on replacing weak words with strong ones.

Today you will: 
• Re-read your entire story
• Revise for voice, details, and strong verbs
• Use a revision checklist

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Voice revision checklist:
✅ Does my narrator sound like a real person with a personality?
✅ Can I hear their voice, or do they sound generic?
✅ Do they react emotionally to events?
✅ Are there moments where I show their thoughts?

Strong verb revision:
Weak: I went to the door. → Strong: I crept toward the door.
Weak: She said angrily. → Strong: She snapped.
Weak: It was scary. → Strong: My skin prickled with dread.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Re-read your ENTIRE story from start to finish. Read it OUT LOUD if possible.

Find your three weakest sentences and rewrite them with stronger verbs and more specific details.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
