UNIT 2  •  LESSON 54 OF 180
Editing and Final Draft
Writing Workshop — Editing and Publishing

📚  Welcome!
Your story is revised and strong. Today, polish it: fix spelling, punctuation, grammar. Then write your final draft.

Today you will: 
• Edit for conventions
• Write your final, polished draft
• Give it a great title

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Editing checklist:
✅ Every sentence starts with a capital letter
✅ Every sentence ends with punctuation
✅ Dialogue has quotation marks
✅ Names and places are capitalized
✅ Spelling is correct
✅ Paragraphs are indented

ITALIC:Editing trick: Read your story backwards, sentence by sentence. This forces you to look at each sentence on its own.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read through your story one final time, fixing ONLY conventions. Then write your clean final draft.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
publish (revisited)  (verb)
