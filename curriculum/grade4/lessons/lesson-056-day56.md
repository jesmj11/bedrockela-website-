Robinson Crusoe: The Footprint
Robinson Crusoe • The Footprint Scene (Excerpt)

📚  Welcome!
One of the most famous scenes in all of literature: a man alone on a desert island finds a single human footprint in the sand. Just a footprint. But it is TERRIFYING.

Today you will: 
• Read the footprint scene from Robinson Crusoe
• Compare Crusoe’s narration to Jim’s
• Analyze how isolation affects a narrator
• Write in your journal

Time: About 45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719 — one of the first novels in the English language. Crusoe has been alone on an island for YEARS when he finds the footprint.

Think about this: Why would a single footprint be terrifying to someone who has been alone for years?

What to look for:
• How does Crusoe’s voice differ from Jim’s?
• How does isolation affect his narration?
• How does he react to the footprint?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the footprint scene from Robinson Crusoe (your teacher will provide the excerpt).

Crusoe has been alone so long that another human’s footprint fills him with terror instead of joy.

Reading tip: Crusoe’s language is old (1719). Read slowly and let the intensity build. This scene is suspenseful because almost nothing happens — it is all internal.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
isolation  (noun)
The state of being completely alone, separated from other people.

From the story: Crusoe’s years of isolation have changed him so much that he fears another human more than he fears being alone.

Think about it: Compare Crusoe (years alone) to Ben Gunn (3 years) to Jim (hours alone on the ship). How does LENGTH of isolation matter?
