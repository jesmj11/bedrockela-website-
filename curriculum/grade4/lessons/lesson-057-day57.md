UNIT 2  •  LESSON 57 OF 180
Unit 2 Assessment: POV Essay
Unit 2 Assessment

📚  Welcome!
Assessment day! This is your chance to show everything you have learned about point of view in Unit 2. You will write a text-evidence essay comparing how POV works in two different texts.

Today you will: 
• Answer comprehension questions reviewing Unit 2 skills
• Write a text-evidence essay about POV

Time: About 55 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
This is not a trick test. You have been practicing these skills for 27 days. You are ready.

The essay asks you to use evidence from TWO texts to discuss how first-person POV affects the reader’s experience. You have done this in your journal many times!

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading. Use your memory, journal, and knowledge of the texts.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
perspective  (noun)
A particular way of seeing or understanding something. In literature, the narrator’s perspective shapes everything the reader experiences.

From the story: Jim’s perspective as a young boy makes us experience Silver’s betrayal with shock and hurt. An adult narrator might have been more suspicious from the start.

Think about it: How does the narrator’s perspective shape what you experience as a reader?
