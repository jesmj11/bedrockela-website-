UNIT 2  •  LESSON 60 OF 180
🎉 Unit 2 Complete: Onward!
Celebration and Looking Ahead

📚  Welcome!
🎉🎉🎉 DAY 60! Unit 2 is DONE!

In Unit 2, you:
• Read an entire novel (Treasure Island — all 34 chapters!)
• Read Sinbad the Sailor and the Robinson Crusoe footprint scene
• Read nonfiction about real pirates
• Wrote 25+ journal entries
• Wrote TWO POV rewrites from Silver’s perspective
• Wrote an informational comparison paragraph
• Wrote and published a 1st-person adventure narrative
• Wrote a text-evidence essay about POV
• Learned 27 vocabulary words
• Mastered dramatic irony, narrator voice, and complex characters

That is AMAZING.

Today you will: 
• Write a letter to yourself about Unit 2
• Set goals for Unit 3
• Get a sneak peek at what is coming next!

Time: About 40 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Close your eyes for 10 seconds and think about your favorite moment from Unit 2. Was it the apple barrel scene? Writing as Silver? Finishing your adventure narrative? The Robinson Crusoe footprint? Hold that moment.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading assignment today. Today is about YOU and your growth.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
transformation (revisited)  (noun)
A major change. You have been transformed as a reader and writer — again.

From the story: In Unit 1, you were transformed from a non-writer to a writer. In Unit 2, you were transformed from a basic writer to one who uses voice, POV, pacing, and complex characters.

Think about it: Look at your Day 1 journal entry vs. your Day 60 work. That transformation is REAL.

✍️  Letter to Yourself + Looking Ahead
Write a letter to yourself about Unit 2.

Dear Me,

Write about:
• What I am most proud of from Unit 2
• The hardest thing I did and how I got through it
• My favorite moment from the reading
• How I have grown as a reader and writer since Day 1
• What I am excited about for Unit 3

🔮 SNEAK PEEK: UNIT 3

Next up: The Call of the Wild by Jack London AND The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.

Two stories about animals in the wild, told in very different ways. Buck is a dog stolen from his California home and forced into the brutal world of the Yukon gold rush. Mowgli is a boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. One story is about losing civilization. The other is about finding it.

If Unit 1 was about what is inside you and Unit 2 was about who to trust, Unit 3 is about survival, nature, and what it means to be wild.

Get ready. The adventure continues in Lesson 61. 🐺
