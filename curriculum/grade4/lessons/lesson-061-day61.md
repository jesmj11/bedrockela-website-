UNIT 3  •  LESSON 61 OF 180
Into the Wild
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 1: Into the Primitive

📚  Welcome!
Welcome to Unit 3! You have read a fairy tale (Oz) and a pirate adventure (Treasure Island). Now you are reading something completely different: a story told from the perspective of a DOG.

The Call of the Wild by Jack London is the story of Buck, a large, pampered dog living in sunny California who is stolen and sold as a sled dog in the frozen Yukon during the gold rush. It is brutal, beautiful, and unlike anything you have read this year.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 1 of The Call of the Wild
• Notice the third-person limited POV — we see through Buck’s eyes
• Compare this opening to the openings of Oz and Treasure Island
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
In Oz, we followed a girl swept away from home. In Treasure Island, we followed a boy dragged into adventure. Now we are following a DOG ripped from everything he knows. Notice the pattern: all three stories start with a character losing their world.

Think about this: Can an animal be the main character of a serious story? Can we understand what an animal feels even though they cannot talk?

What to look for:
• How does London describe Buck’s life BEFORE he is stolen?
• What happens to Buck in this chapter? How is he treated?
• How does London show us what Buck is thinking and feeling without dialogue?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy of The Call of the Wild and read Chapter 1: Into the Primitive.

Warning: this chapter is intense. Buck is kidnapped, beaten, and shipped north in a cage. Jack London does not sugarcoat anything. This book respects you enough to show you the truth about how the world can be.

Reading tip: London uses THIRD-PERSON LIMITED POV. That means the narrator is outside the story (uses he not I) but stays close to Buck’s thoughts and feelings. It is like a camera hovering right over Buck’s shoulder.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
primitive  (adjective/noun)
Relating to the earliest, most basic state of something. Wild, uncivilized, raw. The opposite of tame or civilized.

From the story: The chapter title is Into the Primitive. Buck is being dragged out of his comfortable, civilized life and into a primitive, wild world where only the strong survive.

Think about it: What does it mean to go from civilized to primitive? Is primitive always bad, or can it also mean powerful and free?

A) He is a wild wolf in the forest
B) He is a pampered, well-fed dog living on a large estate in California

B) Third-person limited — the narrator is outside but stays close to Buck’s thoughts
C) Third-person omniscient — we know what everyone thinks
D) Second person — the narrator says you

4. Compare the opening of The Call of the Wild to the openings of Wizard of Oz and Treasure Island. All three main characters are pulled from their normal lives. How is Buck’s experience similar to and different from Dorothy’s and Jim’s?
💡 Hint: Dorothy was swept away by a storm. Jim chose adventure. Buck was STOLEN. What does each opening tell you about the kind of story that follows?

5. London cannot give Buck dialogue — dogs do not talk. So how does London show us what Buck is thinking and feeling? Find one moment where you understand Buck’s emotions even though he never speaks.
💡 Hint: Look for descriptions of Buck’s body language, reactions, and instincts. London shows us Buck’s mind through action.
