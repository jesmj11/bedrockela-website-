UNIT 3  •  LESSON 63 OF 180
The Dominant Primordial Beast
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 3: The Dominant Primordial Beast

📚  Welcome!
Something is changing inside Buck. Old instincts — ancient memories from thousands of years of wolf ancestors — are waking up. Buck is not just adapting to the wild. He is becoming wild.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 3 of The Call of the Wild
• Explore the theme of nature vs. civilization
• Track Buck’s internal transformation
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The big theme of this book is nature vs. civilization. Buck came from the civilized world (houses, food bowls, rules). The Yukon is the natural world (survival, instinct, power). As Buck adapts, he is not just learning new tricks — he is UNlearning civilization and RElearning something ancient.

Think about this: Do you think humans have ancient instincts buried inside them too? What might happen if civilization were stripped away?

What to look for:
• What does London mean by the dominant primordial beast?
• How is Buck’s behavior changing?
• What does Buck dream about at night?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 3: The Dominant Primordial Beast.

This is where Buck starts dreaming of ancient fires and primitive men. London is suggesting that deep inside Buck, there are memories from thousands of generations of wild ancestors. The civilized dog is a thin layer over something much older.

Reading tip: London uses a technique called IMAGERY — vivid descriptions that appeal to your senses. Watch for passages that make you FEEL the cold, HEAR the wolves, SEE the northern lights.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
primordial  (adjective)
Existing from the very beginning of time. Ancient, original, fundamental. The deepest, oldest part of something.

From the story: London calls Buck’s awakening instincts primordial — they come from the very beginning of his species, long before dogs lived with humans.

Think about it: What is the primordial part of YOU? If all of civilization were stripped away, what ancient instincts might emerge?

5. The theme of nature vs. civilization appears in different ways across all your books. In Oz, Dorothy left civilization for a magical world. In Treasure Island, Jim left home for the lawless sea. Now Buck leaves civilization for the wild. Compare how TWO of these characters navigate the tension between the civilized and wild worlds.
💡 Hint: Think about what each character gains and loses when they leave their civilized life behind.
