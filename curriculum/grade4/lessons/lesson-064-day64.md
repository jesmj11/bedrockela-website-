UNIT 3  •  LESSON 64 OF 180
The Fight for Dominance
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 3 (conclusion): Buck vs. Spitz

📚  Welcome!
Buck and Spitz have been circling each other for chapters. Spitz is the lead dog — smart, experienced, ruthless. Buck is the newcomer — bigger, stronger, and getting wilder every day. Today, they fight.

Today you will: 
• Finish Chapter 3 (the fight between Buck and Spitz)
• Analyze conflict: character vs. character AND character vs. nature
• Think about what leadership and dominance mean in the wild
• Write in your journal

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Stories have different TYPES of conflict:
• Character vs. Character (Buck vs. Spitz)
• Character vs. Nature (Buck vs. the Yukon)
• Character vs. Self (Buck vs. his own civilized instincts)
• Character vs. Society (Buck vs. the humans who control him)

The Call of the Wild has ALL of these. Today, character vs. character takes center stage.

Think about this: In nature, leadership is determined by strength and intelligence. In human society, it is more complicated. Which system is more fair?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Finish Chapter 3 if you have not already, focusing on the confrontation between Buck and Spitz.

This fight is the climax of Buck’s early transformation. After this, Buck is no longer a pet learning to survive. He is a leader.

Reading tip: London describes animal conflict without making it cartoonish. It is violent and real. Pay attention to the strategy both dogs use — this is not mindless fighting. It is intelligent combat.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
dominance  (noun)
Power and control over others. In nature, dominance determines who leads, who eats first, and who survives.

From the story: Buck’s fight with Spitz is a fight for dominance — the winner becomes the leader of the pack.

Think about it: Is dominance the same as leadership? Can someone be dominant without being a good leader?
