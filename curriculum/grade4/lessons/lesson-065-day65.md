UNIT 3  •  LESSON 65 OF 180
King of the Trail
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 4: Who Has Won to Mastership

📚  Welcome!
Buck is the lead dog now. He has won through strength and intelligence. But what does leadership look like in the wild? And is Buck becoming more free — or more trapped?

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 4 of The Call of the Wild
• Analyze Buck as a leader
• Explore London’s use of imagery and figurative language
• Write your end-of-week journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Buck has gone from pampered pet to sled dog to pack leader in four chapters. That is a massive character arc. Today, watch how Buck leads — and how London’s writing gets more poetic as Buck gets more wild.

Think about this: When you gain power, does it change who you are? Does leadership reveal your true nature or create a new one?

What to look for:
• How does Buck lead the team? Is he a good leader?
• How does London’s writing style match Buck’s transformation?
• What imagery stands out to you?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 4: Who Has Won to Mastership.

Buck thrives as the lead dog. London’s language becomes more powerful and poetic as Buck connects more deeply with the wild. Watch for figurative language — metaphors and similes that compare Buck to something greater.

Reading tip: FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE is when an author uses comparisons to create vivid images. A simile uses like or as: Buck ran like a ghost through the snow. A metaphor says something IS something else: Buck was a king of the trail. London is full of both.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
mastership  (noun)
Complete skill and control. The state of being a master — having total command over something.

From the story: Buck has won to mastership — he is no longer just surviving. He is thriving, leading, commanding.

Think about it: What is the difference between surviving and achieving mastership? Buck has gone beyond survival. What has he become?
