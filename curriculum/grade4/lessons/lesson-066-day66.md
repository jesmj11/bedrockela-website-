UNIT 3  •  LESSON 66 OF 180
For the Love of a Man
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 5: The Toil of Trace and Trail & Chapter 6: For the Love of John Thornton

📚  Welcome!
Buck gets new owners — and they are terrible. Inexperienced, cruel, and careless, they nearly kill the entire dog team. But then someone steps in and saves Buck’s life. His name is John Thornton, and he will change everything.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapters 5-6 of The Call of the Wild
• Compare two kinds of human-animal relationships
• Explore the theme of love vs. the call of the wild
• Write in your journal

Time: About 55 minutes (two chapters!)

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
So far, humans have mostly been obstacles or tools for Buck. They beat him, worked him, bought and sold him. John Thornton is the first human who treats Buck with genuine love. This creates a new conflict inside Buck: the pull of love vs. the pull of the wild.

Think about this: Can love hold someone back from becoming who they are meant to be? Is it possible for love to be both wonderful and a kind of chain?

What to look for:
• How are the new owners (Hal, Charles, Mercedes) different from previous owners?
• How does Thornton save Buck?
• How does Buck feel about Thornton vs. how he feels about the wild?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapters 5-6. Chapter 5 is dark — the bad owners push the dogs to collapse. Chapter 6 introduces Thornton and is one of the most emotional chapters in the book.

Reading tip: Notice the CONTRAST London creates. Chapter 5 shows the worst of humanity. Chapter 6 shows the best. London is asking: what is the relationship between humans and animals? Who benefits? Who suffers?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
devotion  (noun)
Deep love and loyalty to someone or something. A powerful emotional bond that drives action.

From the story: Buck feels genuine devotion to Thornton — a love so strong that it is the only thing keeping him from answering the call of the wild completely.

Think about it: Can devotion to one person conflict with devotion to your own nature? Is Buck’s love for Thornton holding him back or completing him?

5. Buck now has two pulls: love for Thornton and the call of the wild. This is a CHARACTER VS. SELF conflict. Why is this the most complex conflict in the book? What makes it harder than fighting Spitz or surviving the cold?
💡 Hint: External conflicts have clear winners. Internal conflicts — where both sides of you want different things — have no easy answer.

✍️  Your Reading Journal
Journal entry (paragraph):

•  Compare the two kinds of human-animal relationships in these chapters. What is London saying?
•  Is Buck’s love for Thornton a strength or a chain? Can it be both?
•  Predict: will Buck stay with Thornton or answer the call of the wild?

💡 Reminder: You are now analyzing internal conflict — one of the most sophisticated reading skills. Character vs. self is what makes literature feel REAL.
