UNIT 3  •  LESSON 67 OF 180
Meet Mowgli
The Jungle Book • Mowgli’s Brothers (Chapter 1)

📚  Welcome!
New book! The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling tells the story of Mowgli, a human boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. If Buck is a civilized dog becoming wild, Mowgli is a wild boy who must eventually face civilization. They are mirror images of each other.

Today you will: 
• Read Mowgli’s Brothers from The Jungle Book
• Compare Mowgli’s situation to Buck’s
• Notice the different tone and setting
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The Call of the Wild: a civilized dog becomes wild. The Jungle Book: a wild boy must eventually face civilization. SAME THEME (nature vs. civilization), OPPOSITE DIRECTION. This is why we read these books together.

Think about this: If you were raised by wolves from birth, would you consider yourself human? What makes someone human — biology or culture?

What to look for:
• How does baby Mowgli end up with the wolves?
• Who protects him? Who threatens him?
• What is the Law of the Jungle?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Open your digital copy of The Jungle Book and read Mowgli’s Brothers (the first Mowgli story).

Kipling’s style is very different from London’s. The Jungle Book is more like a fable — the animals talk, they have councils and laws. It feels more like a story ABOUT society using animals as characters.

Reading tip: The Jungle Book was published in 1894 and set in India. The language and style feel different from London’s spare, powerful prose. Kipling is more ornate and storytelling. Both styles are effective — they just create different moods.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
sanctuary  (noun)
A safe place. A shelter or refuge where someone is protected from danger.

From the story: The wolf pack becomes Mowgli’s sanctuary — the one place in the jungle where he is safe and loved.

Think about it: Both Buck and Mowgli find sanctuaries: Buck with Thornton, Mowgli with the wolves. How are these sanctuaries similar? How are they different?
