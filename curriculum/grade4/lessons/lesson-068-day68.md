UNIT 3  •  LESSON 68 OF 180
Baloo and Bagheera
The Jungle Book • Kaa’s Hunting

📚  Welcome!
Mowgli has two teachers in the jungle: Baloo the bear, who teaches him the Law of the Jungle, and Bagheera the panther, who watches over him. Today you will see how Mowgli learns and grows in the wild — and how his human nature sets him apart.

Today you will: 
• Read Kaa’s Hunting from The Jungle Book
• Analyze how Mowgli’s humanity makes him different from the animals
• Compare mentor figures across your books
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Every hero needs mentors. Dorothy had Glinda. Jim had Dr. Livesey. Buck had... well, Buck learned from experience and instinct. Mowgli has Baloo and Bagheera. Watch how these mentors teach differently.

Think about this: What makes a great teacher or mentor? Is it kindness, strictness, or something else?

What to look for:
• How do Baloo and Bagheera teach Mowgli differently?
• What happens when Mowgli is captured by the monkeys?
• What can Mowgli do that the animals cannot?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Kaa’s Hunting. Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys) who have no law and no discipline. Baloo, Bagheera, and the python Kaa must rescue him.

Reading tip: The monkeys represent chaos — they have no law, no structure, no respect for rules. Kipling is contrasting the disciplined jungle (wolves, bears, panthers) with the chaotic jungle (monkeys). This is another layer of the civilization theme.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
discipline  (noun)
Training and rules that develop self-control and orderly behavior. The ability to follow structure even when it is hard.

From the story: Baloo teaches Mowgli discipline through the Law of the Jungle. The monkeys have no discipline, which is why the other animals despise them.

Think about it: Is discipline a civilized quality or a natural one? The wolves have discipline. The monkeys do not. What does that tell you?

3. Compare the mentors across your books: Glinda (Oz), Dr. Livesey (Treasure Island), Baloo and Bagheera (Jungle Book). How does each mentor help their hero? What teaching style does each use?
💡 Hint: Glinda guides with hints. Livesey guides with calm authority. Baloo teaches through the Law. Bagheera protects through action.

4. Mowgli is a human among animals. What can he do that the animals cannot? How does his human nature both help and endanger him in the jungle?
💡 Hint: Mowgli can use tools, make fire, look animals in the eye without fear. But his human nature also makes him different and sometimes unwelcome.
