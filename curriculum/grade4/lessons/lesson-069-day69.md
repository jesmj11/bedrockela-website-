UNIT 3  •  LESSON 69 OF 180
The Sounding of the Call
The Call of the Wild • Chapter 7: The Sounding of the Call

📚  Welcome!
This is the final chapter of The Call of the Wild. Buck must make the ultimate choice: stay with the man he loves, or answer the call that has been pulling him toward the wild since Chapter 1. This ending is one of the most powerful in American literature.

Today you will: 
• Read Chapter 7 — the final chapter
• Analyze how Buck’s internal conflict resolves
• Think about what the ending means
• Write your response to the ending

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Buck has been torn between two worlds: Thornton (love, loyalty, civilization) and the wild (freedom, instinct, nature). Something has to break. One of these worlds is going to win.

Think about this: If you had to choose between someone you loved and the life you felt you were MEANT to live, what would you do? Can you have both?

What to look for:
• What happens to John Thornton?
• What does Buck finally do?
• How does the last page make you feel?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Chapter 7: The Sounding of the Call. This is the ending. Take your time with it.

This chapter has a devastating event and a transcendent ending. London resolves Buck’s internal conflict in a way that is both heartbreaking and triumphant. You may feel two opposite emotions at the same time. That is the sign of great literature.

Reading tip: After you finish, sit with the ending for a moment. How do you feel? What sticks with you? The best books leave you changed, just like they changed their characters.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
transcendent  (adjective)
Going beyond ordinary limits. Rising above the normal world into something greater, freer, more powerful.

From the story: Buck’s final transformation is transcendent — he goes beyond being a dog, beyond being a pet or a sled dog, into something ancient and free.

Think about it: Is Buck’s ending happy or sad? Or is it something beyond happy and sad — something transcendent?

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. What happens to John Thornton?
A) He returns to civilization with Buck
B) He is killed, which frees Buck from his last tie to the human world
C) He abandons Buck
D) He and Buck travel together forever

2. What does Buck do at the end of the book?
A) Returns to California
B) Finds a new human owner
C) Joins a wolf pack and becomes fully wild — answering the call at last
D) Dies in the snow

3. How is Buck’s ending different from Dorothy’s and Jim’s?
A) They are all the same
B) Dorothy returned home. Jim returned home haunted. Buck does NOT return — he goes forward into a completely new life.
C) Buck’s ending is happier than all of them
D) Buck’s ending is sadder than all of them

4. Buck’s internal conflict (love for Thornton vs. call of the wild) is resolved by Thornton’s death. Did London HAVE to kill Thornton for Buck to be free? Could Buck have left on his own? What does this choice tell you about the nature of love and freedom?
💡 Hint: This is one of the deepest questions in the book. London seems to say that Buck’s love was so strong that only death could break it. What does that mean?
[Your answer]

5. Compare the endings of all three novels: Oz (Dorothy clicks her heels), Treasure Island (Jim goes home haunted), Call of the Wild (Buck joins the wolves). What does each ending say about its story’s theme? Which ending affected you the most?
💡 Hint: Oz: you had the power all along. TI: adventure changes you forever. CotW: your true nature will win. Three very different messages.
