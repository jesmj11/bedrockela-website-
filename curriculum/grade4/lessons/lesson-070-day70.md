UNIT 3  •  LESSON 70 OF 180
Two Paths Through the Wild
Comparing The Call of the Wild and The Jungle Book

📚  Welcome!
You have now read enough of both books to do something powerful: put Buck and Mowgli side by side and compare their journeys. Same theme, opposite directions, different conclusions.

Today you will: 
• Compare Buck and Mowgli’s journeys
• Map the nature vs. civilization theme in both books
• Write a comparison paragraph (building toward your Unit 3 essay)
• End-of-week reflection

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
The comparison at a glance:

• Buck: Starts civilized → becomes wild. Leaves humanity behind. Finds freedom.
• Mowgli: Starts wild → must eventually face civilization. Leaves the jungle behind. Finds... what?

Both characters are caught between two worlds. Both must choose. But they choose OPPOSITE directions. That is what makes comparing them so rich.

Think about this: Is Buck’s choice to become wild and Mowgli’s eventual move toward civilization both forms of finding your true self? Or are they fundamentally different?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading today. Use your memory and journal to compare the two books.

Flip back through your notes on both books. Look for parallel moments: both characters have mentors, both have enemies, both have a moment where they must choose between two worlds.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
parallel  (noun/adjective)
Things that are similar or run alongside each other. Parallel stories share patterns even when details differ.

From the story: Buck and Mowgli’s journeys are parallel — they face the same fundamental question (where do I belong?) but arrive at opposite answers.

Think about it: What makes parallel stories so interesting to compare? Why do authors explore the same theme from different angles?

4. Both Buck and Mowgli have a moment where they feel the pull of the OTHER world (Buck hears wolves; Mowgli sees humans). Compare these moments. What do they feel? How do they respond?
💡 Hint: These are the key turning points. The pull of the unknown world is irresistible for both characters.

✍️  Comparison Paragraph: Buck vs. Mowgli
Write one strong paragraph comparing Buck and Mowgli’s journeys. This is practice for your Unit 3 essay.

Your paragraph should include:
• A topic sentence stating the comparison

• One specific detail about Mowgli
• Analysis of what the comparison reveals about the theme
