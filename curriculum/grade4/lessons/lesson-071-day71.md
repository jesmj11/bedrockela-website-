Mowgli Between Two Worlds
The Jungle Book • Tiger! Tiger!

📚  Welcome!
Mowgli’s story reaches its turning point. He must face Shere Khan the tiger — and in doing so, he discovers that he does not fully belong in either the jungle OR the human village. Sound familiar? Buck felt the same pull between two worlds.

Today you will: 
• Read Tiger! Tiger! from The Jungle Book
• Track Mowgli’s identity crisis: human or jungle creature?
• Compare Mowgli’s turning point to Buck’s
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Mowgli goes to the human village and discovers he does not fit in there either. He is too wild for the humans, too human for the animals. This is the heart of his story: belonging nowhere and everywhere at once.

Think about this: Have you ever felt like you did not fully belong in two different groups? Like you were caught between two worlds?

What to look for:
• How do the villagers treat Mowgli?
• How does Mowgli defeat Shere Khan?
• After the victory, does Mowgli belong with the humans or the animals?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read Tiger! Tiger! from The Jungle Book. Mowgli goes to the human village, learns to live among people, but is ultimately rejected. He lures Shere Khan into a trap and destroys his enemy — but the villagers turn on him too.

Reading tip: This story has a bittersweet ending. Mowgli wins the battle but loses his place in both worlds. Pay attention to how Kipling handles this — it is NOT a simple happy ending.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
exile  (noun/verb)
Being forced to leave your home or community. Living away from where you belong, often against your will.

From the story: Mowgli becomes an exile from both worlds — cast out by the village and drifting from the jungle. He belongs to himself alone.

Think about it: Is exile always punishment? Or can it be a kind of freedom? Compare Mowgli’s exile to Buck’s choice to leave the human world.
