UNIT 3  •  LESSON 72 OF 180
Writing Like Jack London
Author Study • Imagery and Figurative Language in The Call of the Wild

📚  Welcome!
Jack London is famous for writing some of the most vivid, powerful descriptions in American literature. Today you are going to study HOW he does it — and steal his techniques for your own writing.

Today you will: 
• Study London’s use of imagery, similes, metaphors, and personification
• Analyze specific passages for craft
• Practice writing your own vivid descriptions using London’s techniques

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
London’s toolkit:

• IMAGERY: Descriptions that appeal to the five senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell)
• SIMILE: A comparison using like or as — The snow fell like ash from a cold fire.
• METAPHOR: Saying something IS something else — The trail was a white ribbon through the darkness.
• PERSONIFICATION: Giving human qualities to non-human things — The cold crept into his bones and whispered stay down.

London uses ALL of these constantly. Today you will find examples and then try writing your own.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new chapter today. Instead, look back through The Call of the Wild and find examples of London’s figurative language. You can flip through any chapter.

Reading tip: When you read like a WRITER, you notice things you missed as a reader. You start asking not just what happened but HOW did the author make me feel that?

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
imagery  (noun)
Vivid, descriptive language that appeals to the senses. Writing that makes you SEE, HEAR, FEEL, SMELL, or TASTE what is being described.

From the story: London’s imagery is so powerful that you can feel the Yukon cold in your bones while sitting in a warm room.

Think about it: Why is imagery more effective than just stating facts? What is the difference between the cold was bad and the cold bit through his fur like a thousand needles?

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. Find ONE example of a SIMILE from The Call of the Wild. Write it down and explain what two things are being compared and why the comparison works.
💡 Hint: Look for the words like or as. London uses them often when describing the landscape, the cold, or Buck’s actions.
[Your answer]

2. Find ONE example of a METAPHOR from The Call of the Wild. Write it down and explain what is being described and what it is being compared to.
💡 Hint: Metaphors do not use like or as. They say something IS something else.
[Your answer]

3. Find ONE example of PERSONIFICATION from either book. Write it down and explain what non-human thing is being given human qualities.
💡 Hint: Look for nature descriptions. Does London or Kipling ever describe the cold, the forest, or the trail as if it were alive?
[Your answer]

4. Now write THREE of your own sentences using London’s techniques:
1. A simile describing extreme cold: ___
2. A metaphor describing a powerful animal: ___
3. A personification of a natural setting (forest, ocean, mountain): ___
💡 Hint: Be specific and vivid. Do not write the forest was scary. Write The forest leaned in close, its branches reaching like fingers.
[Your answer]
