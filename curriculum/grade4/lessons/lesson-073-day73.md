Writing Workshop — Setting and Transformation Essay (Planning)

📚  Welcome!
Your Unit 3 writing project is a descriptive essay about how a SETTING transforms a CHARACTER. This combines everything you have learned: setting as a force, character transformation, figurative language, and strong writing craft.

Today you will: 
• Understand the essay prompt
• Choose your topic (from the books or original)
• Plan your essay with an outline

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
This essay is different from your Unit 1 and Unit 2 narratives. Those were STORIES. This is an ESSAY — it makes an argument and supports it with evidence and description. But it still uses vivid writing!

Essay prompt options (choose ONE):

Option A: How does the Yukon setting transform Buck in The Call of the Wild? Use specific details and figurative language to describe the setting and show how it changes him.

Option B: How does the jungle setting shape who Mowgli becomes in The Jungle Book? Use specific details and figurative language to describe the setting and show how it shapes him.

Option C: Create an ORIGINAL setting and character. Describe a place so vividly that the reader can feel it, and show how that place transforms the character who enters it.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading. This is a planning day.

If you choose Option A or B, flip through the book to find specific passages about the setting that you can reference. If you choose Option C, let your imagination go wild.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
vivid  (adjective)
Producing strong, clear images in the mind. Writing that is so detailed and specific that the reader can picture it perfectly.

From the story: London’s descriptions of the Yukon are vivid — you can see the snow, feel the cold, hear the wolves. Your essay should be just as vivid.

Think about it: What makes writing vivid? It is specificity. Not the place was cold but the wind drove ice crystals into every gap in his fur.

✍️  Plan Your Descriptive Essay
Choose your topic and plan your essay:

I am writing about (circle one): Option A (Buck/Yukon) / Option B (Mowgli/Jungle) / Option C (Original)

My setting: [Describe in 2-3 sentences — what does it look, sound, feel like?]

My character: [Who are they BEFORE entering this setting?]

The transformation: [How does the setting change them? What do they become?]

Essay outline:

Introduction (2-3 sentences): Hook + state how the setting transforms the character

Body paragraph 2 — THE TRANSFORMATION (4-5 sentences): Show how the setting changes the character. Use specific details or text evidence.

Body paragraph 3 — THE MEANING (3-4 sentences): What does this transformation tell us about the nature vs. civilization theme? What is the deeper message?
