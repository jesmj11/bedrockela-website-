UNIT 3  •  LESSON 74 OF 180
Drafting: Paint the Setting
Writing Workshop — Setting and Transformation Essay (Drafting)

📚  Welcome!
Today you write the first half of your essay: the introduction and the setting paragraph. Your goal is to make the reader FEEL the setting — not just know about it. Use every tool London taught you.

Today you will: 
• Write your introduction and setting paragraph
• Use at least 2 examples of figurative language
• Appeal to at least 3 senses

Time: About 45-50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Setting paragraph toolkit:

• Use at least one SIMILE (like/as comparison)
• Use at least one METAPHOR or PERSONIFICATION
• Appeal to SIGHT, SOUND, and at least one other sense (touch, smell, taste)
• Use SPECIFIC details, not vague ones

Examples:
Vague: The Yukon was cold and harsh.
Vivid: The Yukon was a white empire of silence, where the cold did not just surround you — it entered you, settling into your lungs like smoke from an ancient fire.

See the difference? Specificity and figurative language transform flat writing into powerful writing.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading — WRITING DAY!

Use your outline from yesterday. Write your introduction (2-3 sentences) and your setting paragraph (4-5 sentences with figurative language).

Do not rush the setting paragraph. This is where you show off your descriptive skills. Make every sentence count.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
sensory  (adjective)
Relating to the five senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, taste. Sensory writing helps the reader experience the scene physically.

From the story: London’s writing is deeply sensory — you do not just read about the Yukon, you feel the cold on your skin and hear the crunch of snow under paws.

Think about it: Which sense is easiest for you to write about? Which is hardest? Push yourself to use a sense you do not usually think about.
