UNIT 3  •  LESSON 75 OF 180
Drafting: The Transformation
Writing Workshop — Setting and Transformation Essay (Drafting Part 2)

📚  Welcome!
Yesterday you painted the setting. Today you show how that setting CHANGES the character — and explain what it all means. This is where your essay goes from descriptive to analytical. You are not just describing; you are THINKING.

Today you will: 
• Write your transformation paragraph, meaning paragraph, and conclusion
• Use text evidence (for Options A/B) or vivid original details (for Option C)
• Complete your first draft

Time: About 50 minutes of writing

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Transformation paragraph tips:
• Show the character BEFORE and AFTER the setting changes them
• Use specific moments or scenes as evidence
• Explain HOW the setting caused the change (not just that it happened)

Meaning paragraph tips:
• Connect to the theme of nature vs. civilization
• What does this transformation TEACH us?
• This is where you show your thinking, not just your describing

Conclusion tips:
• Echo your introduction
• End with a memorable final line
• Leave the reader with something to think about

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading — WRITING DAY!

Pick up where you left off. Write the remaining three sections of your essay.

The meaning paragraph is the hardest part. You are explaining what the transformation MEANS — what the author (or you) is saying about nature, civilization, freedom, or identity. Take your time with it.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
analytical  (adjective)
Using careful thinking to examine and explain something. Going beyond describing WHAT happened to explaining WHY it matters.

From the story: Your meaning paragraph is analytical — it does not just describe the transformation but explains what it means and why it matters.

Think about it: What is the difference between descriptive writing and analytical writing? Your essay needs BOTH. Describe the setting, then ANALYZE the transformation.
