UNIT 3  •  LESSON 76 OF 180
Revision: Make It Vivid
Writing Workshop — Revising Your Descriptive Essay

📚  Welcome!
Your first draft is done. Today you will make it BETTER. This revision focuses on two things: (1) Is your setting description vivid enough? (2) Is your analysis deep enough?

Today you will: 
• Re-read your entire essay
• Revise for vivid description and strong analysis
• Use a revision checklist

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
This essay has TWO kinds of writing that need revision:

Descriptive writing revision:
• Can the reader SEE, HEAR, FEEL your setting?
• Did you use at least one simile and one metaphor?
• Are your details specific or vague?
Vague: The place was scary. → Vivid: The silence pressed against my ears like a hand.

Analytical writing revision:
• Did you explain HOW the setting changes the character?
• Did you say WHY it matters (connect to theme)?
• Are you THINKING on the page, or just summarizing?
Summary: Buck changed in the Yukon. → Analysis: The Yukon stripped away everything civilized about Buck, revealing an ancient wildness that had been sleeping inside him all along.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Re-read your entire essay. Read it OUT LOUD. Mark places where the description feels flat or the analysis feels thin.

The best revision trick for descriptive writing: close your eyes after reading each sentence. Can you picture it? If not, the description needs work.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
evocative  (adjective)
Bringing strong images, memories, or feelings to mind. Writing that EVOKES a response in the reader.

From the story: London’s writing is evocative — it does not just describe the Yukon, it makes you FEEL like you are there. Your essay should be evocative too.

Think about it: What is the difference between informative writing and evocative writing? Can writing be both?
