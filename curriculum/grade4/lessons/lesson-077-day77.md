UNIT 3  •  LESSON 77 OF 180
Editing and Publishing
Writing Workshop — Final Draft

📚  Welcome!
Your essay is revised. Today, polish it for conventions, write your clean final draft, and give it a title that captures the reader’s attention.

Today you will: 
• Edit for spelling, grammar, and punctuation
• Write your polished final draft
• Create a strong title

Time: About 45-50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Editing checklist:
✅ Every sentence starts with a capital letter
✅ Every sentence ends with punctuation
✅ Spelling is correct (especially character and place names)
✅ Paragraphs are indented
✅ Text evidence is introduced smoothly (not just dropped in)

Title tips:
• A great title hints at the essay’s message without giving everything away
• Try using figurative language in your title
• Examples: White Empire: How the Yukon Made Buck Wild or Between Two Worlds: Mowgli’s Transformation

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read through one final time, fixing ONLY conventions. Then write your final draft.

Read your essay backwards, sentence by sentence. This catches errors your brain skips when reading normally.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
craft (revisited)  (noun)
You learned this word in Unit 2. Now your craft includes descriptive writing, analytical writing, figurative language, and essay structure. Your toolkit keeps growing.

From the story: Your writing craft now includes narrative, POV rewriting, informational paragraphs, and descriptive essays. That is a serious range of skills.

Think about it: Compare your writing from Day 1 to today. How has your craft grown?
