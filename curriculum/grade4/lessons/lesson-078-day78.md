UNIT 3  •  LESSON 78 OF 180
Author’s Chair: Descriptive Essay Edition
Sharing and Celebrating

📚  Welcome!
Time to share your descriptive essays! This is your third Author’s Chair this year, and your writing is noticeably stronger. Read your essay aloud and listen for the moments where your description really lands.

Today you will: 
• Share your descriptive essay (read aloud or to a partner)
• Give and receive feedback focused on vivid description
• Reflect on your growth across three units

Time: About 45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
When sharing your essay:
• Read slowly during the setting paragraph — let the imagery land
• Emphasize your figurative language
• Pause before your final line for effect

Feedback focus today:
• What IMAGE from the essay do you remember most? (This tells the writer which descriptions worked.)
• What IDEA was most interesting? (This tells the writer which analysis worked.)
• One suggestion: Where did you want MORE detail?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read your essay aloud. Then listen to at least one other essay if possible.

Notice which moments get the strongest reactions. The images people remember are the ones that worked best.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
resonance  (noun)
The quality of being deeply meaningful or emotionally impactful. When something resonates, it stays with you after you experience it.

From the story: The best writing has resonance — it stays in the reader’s mind long after they finish reading. Which moments from your essay have resonance?

Think about it: What gives writing resonance? Is it the description, the ideas, or something else?

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. After sharing, reflect: What IMAGE from your essay got the strongest reaction? What made it effective?
