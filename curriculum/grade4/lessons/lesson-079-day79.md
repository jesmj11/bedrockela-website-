UNIT 3  •  LESSON 79 OF 180
Spring Running
The Jungle Book • Mowgli’s final story: Spring Running (or Letting In the Jungle)

📚  Welcome!
Mowgli’s story reaches its emotional conclusion. Just as Buck felt the pull of the wild, Mowgli feels a pull toward the human world. Spring is coming to the jungle, and something in Mowgli is changing.

Today you will: 
• Read Mowgli’s final Jungle Book story
• Analyze Mowgli’s final choice
• Compare Buck’s and Mowgli’s endings
• Write in your journal

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Buck’s ending: He answers the call of the wild and becomes fully animal, running with wolves forever.
Mowgli’s ending: He feels the pull of the human world and must eventually leave the jungle.

OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. Same ache. Same impossible choice.

Think about this: Is it harder to leave a place you love because something is pulling you away, or because you have outgrown it?

What to look for:
• What is changing inside Mowgli?
• How do the jungle animals react to Mowgli’s change?
• Does Mowgli want to leave, or does he feel he must?

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Read the final Mowgli story (Spring Running or Letting In the Jungle, depending on your edition).

Mowgli feels restless. The spring makes him emotional in ways he cannot explain. He is growing up — and growing up means growing away from the jungle.

Reading tip: This ending is quieter than Buck’s. There is no dramatic event that forces Mowgli’s hand. Instead, it is an internal shift — a slow realization that he belongs somewhere else. Sometimes the quietest moments are the most powerful.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
inevitable  (adjective)
Certain to happen. Unavoidable. Something that was always going to occur, no matter what.

From the story: Mowgli’s departure from the jungle feels inevitable. He was always human, even when he lived as an animal. Sooner or later, his human nature was going to win.

Think about it: Was Buck’s transformation also inevitable? Were both characters always destined to become what they became?

3. Compare Buck’s ending to Mowgli’s. Buck GAINS something by answering the wild. Does Mowgli gain or lose by leaving the jungle? Can it be both?

[Your answer]

4. Both endings are about IDENTITY: who am I really? Buck discovers he is wild at his core. Mowgli discovers he is human at his core. Write a paragraph comparing how each character answers the question Where do I belong?
