UNIT 3  •  LESSON 80 OF 180
Nature vs. Civilization: The Big Picture
Unit 3 Review • Connecting Everything

📚  Welcome!
Day 80! Let us step back and look at the big picture. You have read two novels, studied author craft, written a descriptive essay, and explored one of literature’s greatest themes from two opposite angles. Today, pull it all together.

Today you will: 
• Review the nature vs. civilization theme across both books
• Review figurative language and analytical writing skills
• Prepare for next week’s assessment
• Write a reflection

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Unit 3 at a glance:

• The Call of the Wild: Buck goes FROM civilization TO nature. He finds freedom and his true self.
• The Jungle Book: Mowgli goes FROM nature TO civilization. He accepts his human identity.
• Together, they show that nature vs. civilization is not simple. It is not that one is better. It is that every creature must find where they truly belong.

Skills you have built:
• Third-person limited POV
• Setting as a force
• Types of conflict (especially character vs. self)
• Figurative language (simile, metaphor, personification, imagery)
• Descriptive writing
• Analytical writing
• Cross-text comparison

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading. Review day!

Look back through your journal entries from this unit. You have been building toward this moment all along.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
synthesis  (noun)
Combining multiple ideas or sources into a unified understanding. When you put Buck and Mowgli together and draw a BIGGER conclusion, that is synthesis.

From the story: Synthesis means going beyond comparing two books to finding the BIGGER idea they share. Buck and Mowgli tell opposite stories, but together they teach us that everyone must answer the question: where do I belong?

Think about it: How is synthesis different from just comparing? Comparison shows similarities and differences. Synthesis finds the DEEPER MEANING that emerges when you put them together.
