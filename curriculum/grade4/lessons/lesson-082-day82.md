Best Of Unit 3: Portfolio
Portfolio Day

📚  Welcome!
Time to build your Unit 3 portfolio. You have produced incredible work this unit: journals, a descriptive essay, figurative language exercises, comparison paragraphs, and a synthesis essay. Let us collect the best of it.

Today you will: 
• Select your best journal entry from Unit 3
• Select your strongest piece of figurative language
• Select your best paragraph from either essay
• Write reflections and set goals for Unit 4

Time: About 40-45 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Your portfolio now spans THREE units. Look at the progression:
• Unit 1: Hero’s journey narrative, text-evidence essay
• Unit 2: POV rewrites, adventure narrative, POV essay
• Unit 3: Descriptive essay, synthesis essay, figurative language

Each unit has pushed you to do something NEW. That growth is what the portfolio captures.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No new reading. Review your Unit 3 work and select your best pieces.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
portfolio (revisited)  (noun)
Your growing collection of best work. It now spans three units and shows your development as a reader and writer.

From the story: Your portfolio tells the story of YOUR transformation as a writer — from simple journal entries to synthesis essays.
