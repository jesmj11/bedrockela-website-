UNIT 3  •  LESSON 84 OF 180
Bringing the Wild to Life
Readers Theater + Creative Writing

📚  Welcome!
Today is a creative day! You will perform a scene from one of the books, then write your OWN short scene using the skills you have built.

Today you will: 
• Perform a scene from The Call of the Wild or The Jungle Book as readers theater
• Write an original scene using figurative language and strong voice

Time: About 50 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Choose a scene to perform (pick one):
• Buck’s first night in the Yukon (Chapter 2)
• The apple barrel — wait, wrong book! Just kidding. How about...
• Buck vs. Spitz (Chapter 3)
• Mowgli’s adoption by the wolf pack (Mowgli’s Brothers)
• Mowgli vs. Shere Khan (Tiger! Tiger!)

Since these books have limited dialogue, you will need to ADAPT the scene. Turn narration into a script with a narrator and character voices. This is creative interpretation!

Performance tips:
• Narrator reads the description with drama
• Give different characters different voices
• Use pauses for tension

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
Find your chosen scene in the text. Adapt it for performance by identifying the narrator parts and any dialogue or action that can be voiced.

Adapting prose into performance is a creative skill. You are not just reading — you are interpreting the text and making choices about how it should sound.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
interpret  (verb)
To explain or understand the meaning of something in your own way. When you perform a scene, you are interpreting the text through your voice and choices.

From the story: Every reader interprets a book differently. When you perform Buck’s fight with Spitz, your interpretation of Buck’s emotions will be unique to you.

Think about it: How does performing a scene deepen your understanding of it compared to just reading silently?

✅  Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions using what you’ve learned.

1. Which scene did you perform? How did you interpret the emotions and tension?
💡 Hint: What choices did you make about voice, pacing, and emphasis?
[Your answer]

2. How did performing the scene change your understanding of it compared to when you first read it silently?
💡 Hint: Performing forces you to make decisions about HOW characters feel — which requires deeper understanding.

✍️  Write Your Own Wild Scene
Write an original scene (half a page) set in a wild, natural environment. It can feature an animal, a human, or both. Use the skills you have learned:

Requirements:
• A vivid setting described with at least 2 types of figurative language
• A character (animal or human) facing a challenge from nature
• Sensory details (sight + at least 2 other senses)
• Short sentences for tension, longer sentences for description

The forest did not welcome visitors. It tolerated them.
She pressed her back against the rock, listening. The river hissed below like a snake deciding whether to strike.
