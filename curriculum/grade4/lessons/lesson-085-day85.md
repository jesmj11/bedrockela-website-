UNIT 3  •  LESSON 85 OF 180
🎉 Unit 3 Complete: Wild at Heart
Celebration and Looking Ahead

📚  Welcome!
🎉🎉🎉 DAY 85! Unit 3 is DONE! You are almost halfway through the year!

In Unit 3, you:
• Read TWO novels: The Call of the Wild AND The Jungle Book
• Explored the nature vs. civilization theme from opposite angles
• Mastered figurative language: simile, metaphor, personification, imagery
• Wrote a descriptive analytical essay
• Wrote a synthesis essay using evidence from two texts
• Performed readers theater
• Learned 24 vocabulary words
• Reached the deepest level of analysis: SYNTHESIS

That is extraordinary work. You should be genuinely proud.

Today you will: 
• Write a letter to yourself
• Celebrate your halfway milestone
• Get a sneak peek at Unit 4!

Time: About 40 minutes

🧐  Part 1: Before You Read
Close your eyes for 10 seconds and think about your favorite moment from Unit 3. Was it Buck joining the wolves? Mowgli’s bittersweet departure? Writing your descriptive essay? A single image from London’s prose that you can still picture? That is literature living inside you.

📖  Part 2: Today’s Task
No reading today. Today is about YOU.

💬  Part 3: Word of the Day
legacy  (noun)
Something left behind that continues to influence the future. The lasting impact of a person, event, or experience.

From the story: Every book you read leaves a legacy in your mind. Buck’s story, Mowgli’s story, Dorothy’s story, Jim’s story — they are all part of you now.

Think about it: What is the legacy of Unit 3 for you? What will you carry forward from these books?

✍️  Letter to Yourself + Looking Ahead
Write a letter to yourself about Unit 3 and the first half of the year.

Dear Me,

Write about:
• What I am most proud of from Unit 3
• The book or moment that affected me most
• How my reading has changed since Day 1
• How my writing has changed since Day 1
• What I am looking forward to in Unit 4

🔮 SNEAK PEEK: UNIT 4

Next up: Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne PLUS stories and poetry from around the globe.

Phileas Fogg bets that he can travel around the entire world in just 80 days. What follows is a wild, fast-paced adventure through India, Japan, America, and beyond. Along the way, you will read stories and poems from the cultures Fogg visits.

If Unit 1 was about what is inside you, Unit 2 was about who to trust, and Unit 3 was about where you belong, Unit 4 is about how BIG the world is — and how stories connect us across it.

Plus: you will write your first PERSUASIVE essay and your first RESEARCH project. New skills, new worlds, new adventures.

Get ready. Lesson 86 starts the journey. 🌍
