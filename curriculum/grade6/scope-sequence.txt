Program Overview

Philosophy
This 6th grade English Language Arts curriculum uses adventure and travel literature—all from the public domain—to build deep reading comprehension, critical thinking, and skilled writing. By choosing public domain texts, every passage, chapter, and full novel is freely available to every student and teacher through Project Gutenberg and similar resources, eliminating cost barriers and allowing unlimited classroom use of actual text.

Students journey alongside characters who face extraordinary challenges: survival on islands and underground oceans, quests through mythological worlds, time travel across centuries, and the discovery that magic often lies closer to home than we expect. Through these journeys, students develop empathy, resilience, cultural awareness, and a lifelong love of reading.

Reading Comprehension Focus
Reading comprehension is the heartbeat of this curriculum. Each unit features carefully selected passages from the anchor text, paired with targeted questions aligned to specific CCSS standards and organized by Depth of Knowledge (DOK) levels. Students engage daily with close reading, text-dependent questioning, collaborative discussion, and evidence-based writing. Key comprehension skills—citing evidence, determining theme, analyzing craft and structure, integrating information from multiple sources—spiral across all nine units with increasing complexity.

Unit Structure (20 Days Per Unit)
Days 1–3: Unit launch, historical and cultural context, pre-reading activities, vocabulary introduction, and genre study.
Days 4–14: Core reading with daily passage-based comprehension work, close reading lessons, collaborative discussions, paired informational texts, and skill-focused mini-lessons.
Days 15–17: Writing workshop tied to the unit’s writing mode (narrative, argumentative, informational, literary analysis, or poetry).
Days 18–19: Revision, peer feedback, and publishing or presentation.
Day 20: Unit assessment (reading comprehension exam + writing submission) and reflection.

Differentiation and Access
Because all texts are public domain, teachers can freely excerpt, adapt, annotate, and scaffold passages for diverse learners. Many texts are available as free audiobooks through LibriVox. Passage-based comprehension questions include scaffolded versions (with sentence starters and vocabulary support) and extension versions (requiring synthesis and evaluation). Abridged editions are recommended for longer or more complex texts (The Swiss Family Robinson, Treasure Island, A Connecticut Yankee).

Passage: Odysseus and the Cyclops (Book 9)
Odysseus and his men are trapped in the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus. Odysseus devises a plan to blind the Cyclops and escape by hiding under sheep, famously telling Polyphemus his name is ‘Nobody.’ The passage showcases the Greek value of cunning intelligence (metis) over brute strength, but also reveals Odysseus’s fatal flaw of pride (hubris) when he cannot resist shouting his real name.
