## Audio Script for Billy (~3-4 minutes)

**[INTRO - Warm & Excited]**

Hey there, mountain climber! I'm Billy the Goat, and I am SO excited to go on this reading adventure with you!

Today is a super special day. Do you know why? Because today, you're going to learn the SECRET to reading. Yep — the actual secret! And once you know it, you'll be able to read words all by yourself. How cool is that?

**[TEACHING - The Blending Secret]**

Okay, here's the big secret: Words are made of SOUNDS pushed together. 

Let me show you what I mean. Listen to this: /mmm/ - /aaa/ - /p/

Did you hear those three sounds? Now watch what happens when I push them together really fast: /mmm/-/aaa/-/p/... MAP! 

The word is MAP! We call this "blending" — pushing sounds together to make words. You're going to be a blending superstar!

**[TEACHING - Letter Sound: M]**

Let's learn our first sound. This is the letter M. 

The letter M says /mmm/. 

Say it with me: /mmm/

Great! It sounds like when you eat something yummy: "Mmm, delicious!" 

/mmm/ - just like that!

**[TEACHING - Letter Sound: S]**

Next up is the letter S.

The letter S says /sss/. 

Say it with me: /sss/

It sounds like a sneaky snake! Sssssss. 

Can you make the snake sound? /sss/ Perfect!

**[TEACHING - Letter Sound: P]**

Now let's learn the letter P.

The letter P says /p/. It's a quick, quiet sound — just a little puff of air.

Say it with me: /p/

Feel that little puff? That's the /p/ sound. Like when you pop a bubble: /p/!

**[TEACHING - Letter Sound: A]**

Our last sound today is the letter A.

Now A is special — it's called a VOWEL. Every word needs at least one vowel, and A is our first one!

The letter A says /aaa/. 

Say it with me: /aaa/

It's the sound you make when the doctor looks in your throat: "Say /aaa/!" 

**[PRACTICE - Blending Together]**

Okay mountain climber, let's use our new sounds to read a word!

I'll say the sounds slowly, and then we'll blend them together. Ready?

/sss/ - /aaa/ - /mmm/

Let's push them together: /sss/-/aaa/-/mmm/... SAM!

You just read your first word! The word is SAM! Sam could be someone's name!

Let's try another one!

/mmm/ - /aaa/ - /p/

Blend it together: /mmm/-/aaa/-/p/... MAP!

You did it! MAP! A map helps us find our way up the mountain!

**[WRAP UP - Celebration]**

Wow, wow, WOW! You learned FOUR letter sounds today AND you read TWO words! 

Let's remember what we learned:
- M says /mmm/
- S says /sss/  
- P says /p/
- A says /aaa/

And the secret to reading? Push the sounds together — that's called BLENDING!

I'm so proud of you, mountain climber. Now it's time to practice what you learned. You've got this!

See you at the top of the mountain! 🏔️
