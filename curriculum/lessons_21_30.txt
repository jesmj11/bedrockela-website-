Three Billy Goats Gruff - Part 1  Once upon a time, three billy goats lived on a hill. The goats were brothers. The little goat was small. The middle goat was big. The biggest goat was very big and strong. All three goats had the same name. They were all named Gruff. So they were called: Little Billy Goat Gruff Middle Billy Goat Gruff   Big Billy Goat Gruff  The goats lived on one side of a river. They ate grass on their hill every day. But the grass was getting thin. "I am still hungry," said Little Billy Goat Gruff. "Me too," said Middle Billy Goat Gruff. "And me," said Big Billy Goat Gruff.  They looked across the river. On the other side was a big hill. The hill had lots of green grass! "Look at all that grass!" said Little Billy Goat. "It looks so good!" said Middle Billy Goat. "Let's go eat it!" said Big Billy Goat.  But there was one problem. To get to the grass, they had to cross the river. And to cross the river, they had to go over the bridge.

📖 DECODABLE TEXT - Lesson 22
Three Billy Goats Gruff - Part 2  Under the bridge lived a mean old troll. The troll was big and ugly. He had long claws and big teeth. His hair was black and messy. The troll did not like it when anyone crossed his bridge. "This is MY bridge!" the troll would say. "No one can cross without my say so!"  The troll would sit under the bridge all day. He would listen for the sound of feet on the bridge. CLIP CLOP, CLIP CLOP! When he heard that sound, he would jump up! "Who is that crossing my bridge?" he would yell.  The three billy goats did not know about the troll. Little Billy Goat Gruff looked at the bridge. "I will go first," he said. "I am the smallest. I will be the fastest." "Good plan," said his brothers. "We will wait here."  So Little Billy Goat Gruff started across the bridge. His little hoofs went: TRIP TRAP, TRIP TRAP, TRIP TRAP!  The troll heard the sound. He jumped up from under the bridge! "WHO IS THAT CROSSING MY BRIDGE?" roared the troll.  Little Billy Goat Gruff stopped. He was very scared! But he tried to be brave. "It is only me, Little Billy Goat Gruff. I am going to eat grass on the hill."
