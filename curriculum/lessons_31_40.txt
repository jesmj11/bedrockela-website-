Understand the CVCe pattern and 'magic e' concept
Master long A sound in CVCe words: MAKE, TAKE, CAME
Begin Goldilocks and the Three Bears story
Learn sight words 'there' and 'where'
Compare short vs long vowel sounds
📚 SKILLS FOUNDATION
✅ Mastered: All consonant blends, CVC/CCVC words, 30+ sight words 🆕 New Focus: CVCe pattern - consonant, vowel, consonant, silent e 🎯 Key Concept: "Silent e makes the vowel say its name!"
✨ THE MAGIC E RULE
The Magic E Rule: When a word ends in silent e, it makes the vowel before it say its name (long sound).  Examples: • MAT (short a sound) → MATE (long a sound) • CAN (short a sound) → CANE (long a sound) • The e is silent - we don't say it, but it changes everything!
✨ LONG VOWEL FOCUS: Long A (a_e)
CVCe Words: MAKE, TAKE, CAME, GAVE, SAME, NAME

⏰ LESSON STRUCTURE
1. WARM-UP: Blend Review & Magic E Introduction (10 minutes)
🔄 Consonant Blend Quick Review • Flash cards: STOP, CLAP, TRIP, HAND, WOLF • Students read fluently for confidence building • "Great job! Now we're ready for something magical!"  ✨ Magic E Discovery • Show word MAT, have students read it • Add silent E to make MATE • "What happened to the A sound?"

2. EXPLICIT CVCe INSTRUCTION: Long A (12 minutes)
📝 Systematic CVCe Building • Build MAKE with letter tiles: M-A-K-E • Point to each letter: "M says /m/, A says its name /ā/, K says /k/, E is silent" • Practice blending: /m/ /ā/ /k/ = MAKE • Repeat with: TAKE, CAME, GAVE, SAME, NAME  🔄 Transformation Practice • Start with CVC words, add silent E:   - MAT → MATE (sleeping mat vs. friend)   - CAN → CANE (metal can vs. walking cane)   - CAP → CAPE (hat vs. superhero cape) • Students use whiteboards to write transformations

📖 DECODABLE TEXT - Lesson 31
Goldilocks and the Three Bears - Part 1  Once upon a time, three bears lived in a small house in the woods. There was Papa Bear, who was big and strong. There was Mama Bear, who was kind and gentle. And there was Baby Bear, who was small and cute.  One morning, the three bears made hot porridge for breakfast. "This porridge is too hot to eat right now," said Mama Bear. "Let's take a walk in the woods while it cools down," said Papa Bear. "That sounds like a good plan," said Baby Bear.  So the three bears left their house and went for a walk. They did not lock their door. They did not think anyone would come to their house.  But they were wrong!  A little girl named Goldilocks lived near the woods. She had long, curly hair that was the color of gold. That is how she got her name - Goldilocks.  Goldilocks liked to explore and discover new things. But sometimes she was too curious for her own good. She did not always make the best choices.  On this same morning, Goldilocks was taking a walk too. She came upon the bears' house in the woods. "What a cute little house!" she said to herself. "I wonder who lives here."  Goldilocks walked up to the front door. She knocked: KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! But no one answered. "Maybe no one is home," she said. Then she tried the door handle. The door opened right up! 
📖 Guided Reading Process • Teacher models first paragraph with expression • Students echo-read familiar parts • Identify CVCe words: came, make, same, name • Pause for predictions: "What will Goldilocks do?" • Discuss: "Should she go inside? Why or why not?"

📖 DECODABLE TEXT - Lesson 32
Goldilocks and the Three Bears - Part 2  Goldilocks looked around. The house seemed nice and safe. "I think I'll just take a quick look inside," she said. This was not a wise choice!  Goldilocks stepped inside the bears' house. The first thing she saw was a table with three bowls. The bowls were three different sizes. One big bowl, one middle-sized bowl, and one little bowl. All three bowls had porridge in them.  "This porridge smells so good!" said Goldilocks. "I am quite hungry from my long walk. Maybe I could try just a little bit."  First, she tried the porridge in the big bowl. "Ouch! This is too hot!" she said. The porridge burned her tongue!  Then she tried the porridge in the middle-sized bowl. "Yuck! This porridge is too cold!" she said. It did not taste nice at all.  Finally, she tried the porridge in the little bowl. "Mmm! This porridge is just right!" she said. It was not too hot and not too cold. It was the perfect temperature. And it tasted really good!  Goldilocks was so hungry that she ate and ate. Soon she had eaten all the porridge in the little bowl! "That was delicious!" she said. "I feel much better now."  But now Goldilocks was getting tired. She had walked a long way and eaten a big meal. "Maybe I could sit down for just a little while," she thought.
