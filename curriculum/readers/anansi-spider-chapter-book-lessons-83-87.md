# Anansi the Spider (Chapter Book!)
## Lessons 83-87 - Main Idea & Retelling

**Chapter 1: Anansi Gets Stuck**
Anansi the clever spider loved to trick others! One day, he saw Turtle had food. "Share with me!" said Anansi. But when Turtle said "Wash your hands first," Anansi kept getting them dirty on purpose so Turtle would eat alone! Later, Turtle invited Anansi to his underwater home. Anansi dove down but kept floating up! He filled his jacket with rocks to stay down. Turtle said, "We don't wear jackets at the table!" and ate while Anansi floated away, hungry. **Main idea: Tricks can backfire!**

**Chapter 2: Anansi Tricks the Birds**  
Anansi wanted to fly to the birds' feast in the sky. "Can I borrow feathers?" he asked each bird. They gave him feathers and he flew up! At the feast, Anansi said, "This food is for 'All of Us' right?" The birds agreed. "Well," said Anansi, "MY name is 'All of Us'!" and he ate everything! The angry birds took back their feathers. Anansi fell from the sky and cracked his shell—that's why spiders have round bodies today! **Main idea: Greed leads to trouble!**

**Chapter 3: Anansi and the Wisdom Pot**
Anansi collected all the world's wisdom in a pot. "I'll hide it at the top of a tree!" he thought. He tied the pot to his belly and tried to climb, but it kept bumping! His son said, "Why not tie it to your back?" Anansi was so angry that his son was wiser, he dropped the pot! It shattered, and wisdom spread across the world. That's why everyone has some wisdom! **Main idea: You can't keep all wisdom for yourself!**

**Chapter 4: The Lesson Learned**
Anansi realized his tricks often got him into trouble. Sometimes being clever means being KIND, not tricky! Though Anansi still loves a good trick, he learned to think about consequences. **Main idea: Cleverness + kindness = true wisdom!**

**Comprehension Focus:** What's the main idea of each chapter? How do we retell the important parts? Cause & effect in each trick!

**Cultural Note:** Anansi stories come from Ghana, West Africa! Trickster tales teach lessons through humor!
