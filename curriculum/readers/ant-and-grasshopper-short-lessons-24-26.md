### Extension Activities

#### **Work Now, Enjoy Later!**

**The Ant's Choice:**
- WORK in summer → HAVE FOOD in winter ✅

**The Grasshopper's Choice:**
- PLAY in summer → NO FOOD in winter ❌

**Questions:**
- Which choice was smarter?
- Have YOU ever had to work first, then play later?
- What happens if you play BEFORE finishing your work?

**Examples:**
- Homework FIRST, then video games ✅
- Reading practice FIRST, then TV ✅
- Clean room FIRST, then play outside ✅

---

#### **Seasons & Planning**

**Summer:** Warm, lots of food growing, good time to PREPARE

**Autumn:** Getting colder, food disappearing, LAST CHANCE to prepare

**Winter:** Cold, no food growing, too late to prepare—you need what you stored!

**Spring:** Warm again, new food growing, fresh start!

**Question:** What season is it NOW? What should you be preparing for?

---

#### **Cause & Effect**

| CAUSE (Choice) | EFFECT (Result) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Ant worked all summer | Ant has food in winter |
| Grasshopper played all summer | Grasshopper has NO food in winter |
| Grasshopper didn't plan | Grasshopper is hungry and cold |
| Ant planned ahead | Ant is warm and fed |

**Big Lesson:** Your CHOICES have CONSEQUENCES!

---

#### **Act It Out**
- **Summer Scene:** Ant works (lift, lift!), Grasshopper plays (hop, hop!)
- **Autumn Scene:** Ant still working, Grasshopper still playing
- **Winter Scene:** Snow! Cold! Grasshopper is hungry!
- **Ant's Nest:** Grasshopper knocks, asks for food
- **Ending:** Ant has food, Grasshopper learned a lesson

Take turns being each character!

---

#### **Compare the Characters**

| ANT | GRASSHOPPER |
|-----|-------------|
| Hard-working | Lazy |
| Plans ahead | Doesn't plan |
| Thinks about future | Lives in the moment |
| Prepared | Unprepared |
| Has food in winter | Hungry in winter |

**Question:** Which character are YOU more like? Which do you WANT to be like?

---

#### **Modern Application: Homework & Chores**

**Ant Approach:**
- Do homework right after school
- Finish chores before playing
- Study for tests ahead of time
- **Result:** Prepared, less stress, more free time later!

**Grasshopper Approach:**
- Put off homework until bedtime
- Avoid chores
- Wait until last minute to study
- **Result:** Stressed, rushing, no time for fun!

**Which is better?**

---

#### **Compare to Other Stories**
- **Little Red Hen:** She worked, others didn't—consequences!
- **Three Little Pigs:** Big pig worked hard on brick house, other pigs didn't—consequences!
- **Ant & Grasshopper:** Ant worked, grasshopper didn't—consequences!
- **Pattern:** HARD WORK = GOOD RESULTS!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "Learning to read is like the ant's work! You practice a LITTLE BIT every day (plant those reading seeds!), and by the END of the year, you can read ANYTHING (you have plenty of 'food' stored up!). Don't be like the grasshopper and say 'I'll practice later!' Practice NOW, read LATER!"

Also: This story is FULL of blends! **Gr**asshopper, **pl**ant, **st**ore, **fr**ost, **sp**ring! When you practice blends NOW, reading gets easier LATER!
