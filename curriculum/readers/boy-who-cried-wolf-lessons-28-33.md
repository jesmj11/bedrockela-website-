#### **Moral/Lesson**
This is a **fable** — a story that teaches a lesson.

**The lesson:** When you lie, people will not trust you. Even when you tell the truth, they might not believe you.

**Other ways to say it:**
- "Honesty is the best policy"
- "If you lie, people won't believe you when you tell the truth"
- "Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose"

**Question:** How can you be an honest person?

#### **Compare to Other Stories**
- **Three Billy Goats Gruff:** The troll tried to trick the goats, but the BIG goat stopped him. The boy tried to trick the people, and he got in trouble.
- **Three Little Pigs:** The pigs who worked hard (big pig) had good consequences. The boy who lied had bad consequences.
- **Connection:** Your CHOICES have CONSEQUENCES!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat teaches honesty on the reading mountain! When you make a mistake, you admit it and try harder next time. You don't trick your teacher or parent by pretending to read when you're guessing. Billy says: **Be honest, work hard, and people will trust you!**

Also: The boy's job was to watch SHEEP (animals). Billy is a GOAT (also an animal). What other animal jobs can you think of?
