## Lessons 97-99 - Problem/Solution & Making Connections

**TRUE STORY from Malawi, Africa!**

**Problem:** William Kamkwamba's village had no rain. Crops died. People were hungry. There was no electricity, no water pumps.

William loved to learn but couldn't afford school. He read books at the library.

One day he read about windmills. "A windmill can pump water AND make electricity!" he realized.

**Solution:** William built a windmill from trash! He used:
- Bicycle parts
- Blue gum trees  
- Old pipes
- A tractor fan

People laughed. "Crazy boy!" they said. But William kept working.

At last, the windmill spun! It powered a light bulb! Then it pumped water for crops!

Soon the whole village had electricity and water! William became famous! He went to college and became an engineer!

**Problem → Solution:** No water/power → Built windmill from trash → Village saved!
