## The Story

### Page 1
Once upon a **day**, there lived a little **tailor**. He **made** clothes. He sat and sewed all **day** long.

One **day**, he **made** some jam. He put it on bread.

But flies came! Seven flies landed on his jam!

[Buzz like flies! Seven flies on the jam!]

---

### Page 2
"Go **away**, flies!" said the **tailor**. He was mad.

He grabbed a cloth. **SMACK!**

He hit all seven flies at once! They all fell down.

"Seven at one blow!" he cried. "I am **brave**!"

[Say it loud and proud: "Seven at one blow!"]

---

### Page 3
The **tailor** **made** a belt. On it, he wrote:

**"SEVEN AT ONE BLOW!"**

He put on the belt. He felt very **brave**.

"I will go out into the world!" he said. "I will show everyone how **brave** I am!"

And off he went.

[Act confident like the tailor! Stand tall!]

---

### Page 4
As the **tailor** walked, he **came** to a big hill. A giant sat on top!

The giant saw the belt. It said, "SEVEN AT ONE BLOW!"

"Wow!" said the giant. "You must be very strong! Did you defeat seven men at one blow?"

The **tailor** just smiled. He did not **say** he meant flies!

[The tailor is being clever! He didn't lie, but he didn't explain!]

---

### Page 5
"Let me test you," said the giant. He picked up a rock. He squeezed it. Water dripped out!

"Can you do that?" asked the giant.

The **tailor** thought fast. He had some cheese in his pack. He pulled it out and squeezed. **Whey** dripped out!

"Of course I can!" said the **tailor**.

[The tailor is smart! He used cheese, not a rock!]

---

### Page 6
The giant was amazed. "Okay, let's see you throw," he said.

The giant threw a rock. It flew far, then fell.

The **tailor** had a little bird in his pack. He threw the bird up into the sky!

The bird flew **away** and did not come back!

"Mine did not fall!" said the **tailor**. "It flew **away**!"

[The tailor tricks the giant again!]

---

### Page 7
The giant was impressed. "Come **stay** with me!" he said.

That night, the **tailor** slept in the giant's cave. But the bed was too big!

So the **tailor** slept in the corner instead.

The giant tried to smash the bed in the night! But the **tailor** was **safe** in the corner!

[Smart thinking kept the tailor safe!]

---

### Page 8
In the morning, the giant ran **away**. He thought the **tailor** was too strong to defeat!

The **tailor** kept walking. He **came** to a castle.

The king saw his belt: "SEVEN AT ONE BLOW!"

"You are very **brave**!" said the king. "Will you help me? A dragon is in the woods. It will not go **away**."

[Now there's a real challenge! A dragon!]

---

### Page 9
The **tailor** agreed. He went into the woods.

He found the dragon. It was huge! But it was asleep and snoring.

The **tailor** climbed a tree. He dropped pebbles on the dragon's nose.

The dragon woke up! It thought another dragon hit it!

[Clever again! The tailor makes the dragon confused!]

---

### Page 10
The dragon roared! It looked around. It saw its own shadow and thought it was another dragon!

The two "dragons" (really just one confused dragon!) fought. The dragon chased its own **tail**!

It got so dizzy, it ran **away** into the hills!

The **tailor** climbed down. "The dragon is gone!" he called.

[The dragon fought itself! The tailor was very clever!]

---

### Page 11
The king was amazed! "You are the **bravest** man I know!" he said.

"You **may** marry my daughter and live in the castle!"

And so the little **tailor** became a prince! He lived happily ever after.

All because he was clever and **brave**!

[The tailor used his brain, not his muscles!]

---

### Page 12
**"SEVEN AT ONE BLOW!"**

And that is the story of the **brave** little **tailor** who defeated seven flies, tricked a giant, and chased away a dragon—all with cleverness and courage!

[The end! What a clever hero!]
