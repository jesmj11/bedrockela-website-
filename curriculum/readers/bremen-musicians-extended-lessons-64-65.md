## The Story

Once there **was** a donkey. He **was** old and tired.

His owner did not want him anymore. "You are no good!" said the man.

So the donkey set off down the road.

[An old donkey runs away!]

As the donkey walked, he saw a dog lying by a **hedge**.

The dog looked tired and sad.

"What is **wrong**?" asked the donkey.

[A sad dog by the hedge!]

Night fell. The animals **were** tired and hungry.

They saw a light in the distance.

"Let's go see!" said the donkey. "Maybe we can rest there."

They walked to the **edge** of the forest. They saw a little cottage! Light glowed from the window.

[A cottage in the woods!]

The donkey looked in the window.

Inside **were** robbers! They sat around a table piled with food!

The robbers **were** counting stolen gold and jewels!

"We must **catch** them!" whispered the dog. "They are thieves!"

"But how?" asked the cat. "There are four of them!"

[Robbers! With stolen treasure!]

### Page 10
The donkey had an idea. "Let's **match** our voices together! We will make such a loud noise, they will run away!"

"Good plan!" said the dog.

The donkey stood under the window. The dog stood on the donkey's back. The cat climbed onto the dog. The rooster perched on top of the cat.

[Stacking up! A tower of animals!]

The donkey: **"HEE-HAW!"**  
The dog: **"WOOF-WOOF!"**  
The cat: **"MEOW!"**  
The rooster: **"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!"**

The sound **was** LOUD! VERY loud!

[Make the sounds together! LOUD!]

[The robbers are terrified! They run away!]

The four friends tumbled through the window. They landed in a **patch** on the floor!

They looked around. Food! A warm fire! Soft beds!

"This is perfect!" said the donkey. "Let's stay here!"

They ate the food. They rested by the fire. They felt safe and happy.

[The cottage is theirs now!]

[The animals defended their new home!]
