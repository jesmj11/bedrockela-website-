## Back Matter

### Sound Words Practice (ONOMATOPOEIA!)

**Onomatopoeia** = Words that sound like what they mean!

**Animal Sounds in This Story:**
- **Donkey:** HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW!
- **Dog:** WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!
- **Cat:** MEOW! MEOW! MEOW!
- **Rooster:** COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!

**Other Sound Words:**
- **CRASH!** (falling through window)

- **Munch, munch, munch** (eating)

**Practice:** What sounds do these make?
- A door: SLAM! CREAK!
- Eating: MUNCH! CRUNCH!
- Water: SPLASH! DRIP!
- Footsteps: STOMP! TAP! TIP-TOE!

---

### Blending Practice: Blends in the Story

**Initial Blends:**
- **Bremen** (br-)
- **friends** (fr-)
- **stand** (st-)
- **stomp** (st-)
- **crept** (cr-)
- **scare** / **scared** (sc-)

**Final Blends:**
- **roost** (-st)
- **robbers** (double consonant + blend)

**Practice Sentence:**  
"My best **fr**iends will **st**and and **st**omp to **sc**are the robbers in **Br**emen!"

---

### Repeated Phrases to Practice
"**What** is wrong?"  
"I have **no** home."  
"**Come** with us! We **will** be **musicians**!"  
"**HEE-HAW! WOOF! MEOW! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!**"  
"**They** ran and ran and ran!"

---

### Extension Activities

#### **Teamwork Tower!**
Act out the story's BEST part:
- Four people (or stuffed animals!) stand on each other
- (Safely! Maybe just stack toys or use your hands!)
- Everyone makes their animal sound AT THE SAME TIME!
- Fall down (gently!) like they crashed through the window!

**Lesson:** Together, we can do BIG things!

---

#### **Make Your Own Animal Band**
- Each person picks an animal
- Make that animal's sound
- "Conduct" the band: Point to each person, they make their sound!
- Try it LOUD! Try it soft! Try it FAST!
- You're musicians too!

**Animal Ideas:**
- Dog: WOOF!
- Cat: MEOW!
- Cow: MOO!
- Pig: OINK!
- Duck: QUACK!
- Sheep: BAA!

---

#### **Onomatopoeia Hunt**
Find sound words in OTHER stories!
- **Billy Goats Gruff:** Tap, tap, tap! Stomp, stomp, stomp! Nom, nom, nom!
- **Three Little Pigs:** Huff, puff, WHOOSH, CRASH!
- **Goldilocks:** Knock, knock! Creak, creak! CRACK! BOOM!

**Make a list!** How many sound words can you find?

---

#### **Problem & Solution**

| PROBLEM | SOLUTION |
|---------|----------|
| Animals have no home | They go to Bremen to be musicians |
| They're hungry and tired | They find a house |
| Robbers are in the house | They scare them away with music! |
| Robbers might come back | Animals defend the house! |

**Lesson:** Every problem has a solution! Work together!

---

#### **Sequence the Story**
Put these in order:
1. Donkey meets dog
2. Dog meets cat
3. Cat meets rooster
4. They find house with robbers
5. They make music and scare robbers
6. They eat and sleep
7. Robber comes back
8. Animals scare him again!
9. They live happily in the house

---

#### **Character Traits**
Each animal was:
- **Brave** (faced the robbers!)
- **Helpful** (helped each other)
- **Creative** (made a plan to scare robbers)
- **Loyal** (stuck together as friends)

**Talk about it:**
- Have YOU ever been brave?
- How do YOU help your friends?
- What creative ideas have YOU had?

---

#### **Compare to Other Stories**
- **Enormous Turnip:** Everyone worked together to pull it up!
- **Bremen Musicians:** Everyone worked together to scare robbers!
- **Little Red Hen:** She did NOT work together (friends didn't help!)
- **Connection:** Teamwork is powerful!

---

#### **Draw the Tower**
Draw the four animals standing on each other:
1. Donkey on bottom (biggest)
2. Dog on donkey
3. Cat on dog
4. Rooster on top (smallest)

Label each animal! Draw sound bubbles coming from their mouths!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "Just like the four animals became musicians by practicing their sounds together, YOU become a reader by practicing your LETTER SOUNDS together! HEE-HAW is made of sounds /h/ /ē/ /h/ /aw/! When you blend sounds, you make WORDS! That's music to my ears!"

Also: The animals were all DIFFERENT (donkey, dog, cat, rooster), but together they were STRONGER! In reading, you use DIFFERENT skills together (sounds, blending, sight words) to become a STRONG reader!
