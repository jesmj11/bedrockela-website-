# Caps for Sale
## Lessons 81-82 - Fluency & Sound Effects

A peddler sold caps, stacked high on his head. "Caps! Caps for sale! Fifty cents a cap!"

He took a nap under a tree. When he woke—his caps were GONE! Monkeys had stolen them!

"You monkeys! Give me back my caps!" he shouted, shaking his fist.

The monkeys shook their fists! "Eee eee eee!"

He stomped his foot. The monkeys stomped! "Eee eee eee!"

Finally, he threw his own cap down in anger. The monkeys threw their caps down too!

The peddler gathered all his caps. "Caps! Caps for sale!" he called, walking away.

**Lesson:** Sometimes the solution is surprising! The monkeys copied everything he did!

**Reading Focus:** Smooth, rhythmic reading. "Caps! Caps for sale!" refrain. Sound effects: Eee eee eee!
