## The Story

### Page 1
Once there were two mice. One lived in the country. One lived in the city.

They were cousins.

One day, Country Mouse invited City Mouse to visit.

"Come see my home!" he said. "It is simple, but nice."

[Two cousins! One country, one city!]

---

### Page 2
City Mouse took the train. She rode **first** class!

When she arrived, Country Mouse met her at the **corner** of the field.

"Welcome!" he said. "Come, I will show you my home!"

They walked through tall grass. Birds **chirped**. The sun was warm.

[Country Mouse is happy to show his home!]

---

### Page 3
Country Mouse lived in a cozy burrow under a **fir** tree.

Inside, it was simple. A bed of soft grass. A small table.

"Sit!" said Country Mouse. "I will make us **dinner**!"

He served seeds, **corn**, and fresh water.

[A simple home. Simple food. But cozy!]

---

### Page 4
City Mouse looked at the food. She wrinkled her nose.

"Is this all?" she said. "Just seeds and **corn**?"

"Yes," said Country Mouse. "But it is fresh! I picked it this morning."

City Mouse nibbled a seed. It **was** plain.

"You poor thing," she said. "You must come visit me! I will show you how fancy mice live!"

[City Mouse thinks this is boring!]

---

### Page 5
The next week, Country Mouse took the train to the city. He rode **third** class.

City Mouse met him at the **curb**. Cars zoomed by! Horns honked!

"This way!" said City Mouse. "Hurry! Don't get **hurt**!"

Country Mouse's heart began to beat fast. The city **was** loud and busy!

[The city is noisy! Country Mouse is nervous!]

---

### Page 6
City Mouse lived in a grand house. She had a little hole in the wall behind the kitchen.

Inside, her home **was** fancy! A soft cushion bed. A **mirror**. A tiny **silver** spoon!

"Wow!" said Country Mouse. "This is **very** nice!"

"Wait until you see **dinner**!" said City Mouse.

[City Mouse's home is FANCY!]

---

### Page 7
That night, the mice snuck into the kitchen. The table **was** full of food!

Cheese! Cake! Roast beef! **Butter**! Fresh bread!

"Help yourself!" said City Mouse.

Country Mouse's eyes grew wide. "I have **never** seen so much food!"

He took a bite of cheese. It **was** delicious!

[So much fancy food! Country Mouse is amazed!]

---

### Page 8
Suddenly, the door **burst** open!

A huge cat ran in! It **was** the house cat!

"Run!" cried City Mouse. "Hurry! **Turn** here!"

The mice ran as fast as they could! The cat chased them! It **purred** and licked its chops!

[Danger! The cat is chasing them!]

---

### Page 9
The mice dove into the wall. They were safe. But Country Mouse's heart pounded.

"That **was** close!" he gasped. "I almost got **hurt**!"

"Oh, that happens all the time," said City Mouse calmly. "You get used to it."

Country Mouse **was** **very** scared. His **fur** stood on end.

[Country Mouse does NOT like this!]

---

### Page 10
"Let's go back and eat!" said City Mouse. "The cat will leave soon."

But Country Mouse shook his head.

"No thank you," he said. "I would rather eat plain seeds in peace than fancy food in fear."

"I am going home," he said. "I miss my quiet burrow."

[Country Mouse has made his choice!]

---

### Page 11
Country Mouse took the train back home. He **was** happy to see his field again!

Birds **chirped**. The grass swayed. It **was** quiet and safe.

He ate his simple **dinner** of seeds and **corn**. No cat chased him. No danger.

"This is the life **for** me," he said happily.

[Home sweet home!]

### Page 12
