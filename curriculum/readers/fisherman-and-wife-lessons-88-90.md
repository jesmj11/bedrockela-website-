# The Fisherman and His Wife
## Lessons 88-90 - Main Idea & Summarizing

A poor fisherman caught a magic fish. "Please let me go!" said the fish. "I'll grant wishes!" The kind fisherman let him go.

His wife was angry. "You should have asked for a wish! Go back and ask for a nice cottage!" The fisherman did, and POOF! They had a cottage.

But the wife wanted MORE. "Ask for a castle!" POOF! They had a castle.

"I want to be QUEEN!" POOF! She became queen. "I want to be EMPRESS!" POOF! She became empress.

"I want to control the SUN and MOON!" she demanded. The fish had enough. POOF! They were back in their old shack.

**Main Idea:** Greed destroys happiness. Be grateful for what you have!

**Details that support main idea:** Wife wanted more and more, never satisfied, lost everything in the end.

**Summarizing:** Fisherman catches magic fish → wife keeps asking for more → wife gets too greedy → they lose everything.
