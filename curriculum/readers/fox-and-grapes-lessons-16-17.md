## The Story

### Page 1
A **fox** was hot.

"I am **so** hot!" said the **fox**.

"I wish I had something to eat!"

[Fan yourself! So hot!]

---

### Page 2
The **fox** saw some **grapes**  
up on a vine.

The **grapes** looked **yum**!

"I will get those **grapes**!" said the **fox**.

[Point up high! Look at those grapes!]

---

### Page 3
The **fox** **jumped**!

**Jump! Jump! Jump!**

But he could **not** get the **grapes**.

They were too high.

[Jump! Jump! Jump! Try to reach!]

---

### Page 4
The **fox** **jumped** again!

**Jump! Jump! Jump!**

He **jumped** **six** times!

But he **still** could **not** get the **grapes**.

[Jump six times! Count them!]

---

### Page 5
The **fox** **quit**.

"I am **quick**, but I **cannot** get them," said the **fox**.

He **sat** down.

[Sit down. Give up. Quit.]

---

### Page 6
**Then** the **fox** said,

"I did **not** want those **grapes** anyway!  
They are **too** **sour**!  
I only like **sweet** **grapes**!"

And the **fox** walked away.

[Use a snooty, excuse-making voice!]

---

### Page 7
But the **grapes** were **NOT** **sour**.

The **grapes** were **sweet** and **yum**!

The **fox** just said that  
because he could **not** get them!

**The lesson:**

It is easy to make **excuses**  
when you **cannot** get what you want!

**The end!**

[Shake your head—those grapes weren't sour!]

### Extension Activities

#### **The "Sour Grapes" Saying**
This story is where the saying "**sour grapes**" comes from!

**"Sour grapes" means:** Making excuses and pretending you didn't want something when you REALLY did want it but couldn't get it.

**Examples:**
- "I didn't want to win that game anyway!" (sour grapes!)
- "That toy is probably broken!" (sour grapes!)
- "I didn't want to go to that party!" (sour grapes!)

**Question:** Have YOU ever said "sour grapes"? When?

---

#### **Honesty vs. Excuses**
**What the fox SHOULD have said:**  
"I tried my best, but I can't reach them. Maybe I need help or a ladder!"

**What the fox DID say:**  
"I didn't want them anyway! They're sour!"

**Which is better?**
- Being HONEST (admitting you can't do something)
- Making EXCUSES (pretending you didn't want it)

**Talk about it:**
- It's OK to not be able to do something!
- It's NOT OK to make excuses or lie!
- Asking for HELP is better than giving up and lying!

---

#### **Act It Out**
- Be the fox!
- Jump and try to reach something high (grapes, or a toy on a shelf)
- Count: Jump 1, jump 2, jump 3, jump 4, jump 5, jump 6!
- Sit down and quit
- Make a grumpy face and say, "I didn't want it anyway!"
- Then laugh because the fox was being silly!

---

#### **Problem-Solving Discussion**
**The fox had a PROBLEM:** Grapes too high

**What could he have done instead of quitting?**
- Ask a friend for help
- Find a box to stand on
- Get a stick to knock them down
- Find a ladder
- Wait for the grapes to fall

**Lesson:** Don't give up! Find another way!

---

#### **Compare to Other Stories**
- **Lion & Mouse:** The lion NEEDED help and got it
- **Fox & Grapes:** The fox NEEDED help but DIDN'T ask for it—he made excuses instead!
- **Connection:** It's OK to ask for help!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "When reading gets hard, don't say 'I didn't want to read that book anyway!' That's SOUR GRAPES! Instead, say 'This is tricky, but I can practice and get better!' Don't make excuses—keep trying!"

Also: The fox jumped SIX times! That's X practice! When you practice reading SIX times (or more!), you get better and better!
