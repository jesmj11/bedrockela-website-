## The Story

### Page 1
An old woman made a **gingerbread** boy. She gave him raisin eyes and a smile.

"**Someone** will love to eat you!" she said.

She put him in the oven to bake.

But when she opened the oven door, the **gingerbread** boy jumped out!

"You **can't** catch me!" he cried. And he ran **outside**!

---

### Page 2
The old woman ran after him. "Come back!"

But the **gingerbread** boy just laughed. "Run, run, as fast as you can! You **can't** catch me, I'm the **gingerbread** man!"

He ran past **everyone** he saw. The old man tried to catch him. The cow tried too. But **they** **couldn't** catch him!

### Page 3
The **gingerbread** boy came to a river. He **couldn't** swim!

A fox was sitting by the water. "I **won't** eat you," said the fox. "But I can help you across. Jump on my back!"

The **gingerbread** boy jumped on. But halfway across, the fox tossed him up and—SNAP!—ate him in one bite!

**THE END**

"**Don't** be too sure of **yourself**!" said the fox.
