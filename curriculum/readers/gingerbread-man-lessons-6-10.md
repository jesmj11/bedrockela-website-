- Fall down laughing at the end!

- The fox SAID he would help
- But he ATE the gingerbread man!
- He was TRICKY / CLEVER / SLY
- Can someone seem nice but not be nice?
- Don't trust strangers!

#### **Cause & Effect**
- CAUSE: Woman opened the oven → EFFECT: Gingerbread man ran away
- CAUSE: Animals chased him → EFFECT: He ran to the river
- CAUSE: He couldn't swim → EFFECT: He asked fox for help
- CAUSE: He hopped on the fox's nose → EFFECT: Fox ate him! SNAP!

#### **Make Your Own Gingerbread Man**
- Draw a gingerbread man

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "Don't run away from your lessons! The gingerbread man ran away and got into trouble. But when you RUN TOWARD your reading practice (not away!), you get BETTER, not EATEN!" 

Also: The gingerbread man was fast, but the clever fox was SMARTER. In reading, being CLEVER (thinking about what you read) is better than being FAST!
