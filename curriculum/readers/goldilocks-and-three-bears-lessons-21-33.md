### Extension Activities

#### **Blend Hunt**
- **Initial Blends:** Find all the words that START with two letters blending together (brown, black, fresh, glad, green, grass, gruff)
- **Final Blends:** Find all the words that END with two letters blending together (fast, just, best, last, rest, lost, soft, left, felt, and)
- Make two lists!

#### **Act It Out**
- Be Goldilocks! Try three chairs (big pillow, medium pillow, small pillow). Say "Too hard! Too soft! Just right!"
- Be the three bears! Use three different voices (deep, medium, high)
- Act out Goldilocks running away! Run in place!

#### **Three of Everything**
- Draw three bowls, three chairs, three beds
- Find three toys in your house — big, medium, small
- Practice comparing: bigger, biggest / smaller, smallest / softer, softest

#### **Problem-Solving Discussion**
- Goldilocks broke Baby Bear's chair. What should she do?
- How could Goldilocks have been a better guest?
- What would you say to Goldilocks if you met her?

#### **Sequence Practice**
- What happened FIRST? (Bears made oats and went for a walk)
- What happened NEXT? (Goldilocks came in)
- What happened AFTER THAT? (She tried the bowls, chairs, beds)
- What happened LAST? (Bears came home, Goldilocks ran away)

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat teaches kids to try hard things on their reading journey — sometimes the lesson is "too hard," sometimes "too easy," but when it's "just right," you learn the best! Just like Goldilocks found what was "just right" for her.

Also: Both stories have THREE characters (three goats, three bears). Can you think of other stories with three main characters?

## Additional Teaching Notes

### Character Discussion:
- **Goldilocks:** Curious but didn't make good choices (went into a house without permission, broke things)
- **Baby Bear:** Kind, shares his things even though they get broken/eaten
- **Three Bears:** Fair (they let Goldilocks go, they don't hurt her)

### Cause & Effect Practice:
- CAUSE: The oats were too hot → EFFECT: The bears went for a walk
- CAUSE: Goldilocks sat in the small chair → EFFECT: The chair broke
- CAUSE: The bears came home → EFFECT: Goldilocks ran away

### Comparative Language:
- Big, bigger, biggest
- Small, smaller, smallest
- Hard, harder, hardest
- Soft, softer, softest
- This is perfect for teaching comparatives (Lesson 73 preview!)
