## The Story

### Page 1
Once upon a time, in a **wood**, there **were** three bears.

Papa Bear **was** big. Mama Bear **was** medium. Baby Bear **was** small.

They lived in a **good** little house in the **woods**.

One morning, Mama Bear made porridge for breakfast. It **was** hot! Too hot to eat!

[Three bears in the woods! Porridge is too hot!]

---

### Page 2
"Let's go for a walk in the **wood** while it **cools**," said Mama Bear.

"**Good** idea!" said Papa Bear.

The three bears walked out the door. They left it open to let **cool** air in.

Soon they were walking among the trees, enjoying the morning.

[The bears went for a walk. The door is open!]

---

### Page 3
A little girl named Goldilocks **was** walking in the **wood** that morning **too**.

She had **golden** hair that shone in the sun.

Goldilocks saw the bears' house. She **looked** in the window.

"A house in the **woods**!" she said. "I wonder who lives here?"

[Goldilocks found the house!]

---

### Page 4
Goldilocks knocked on the door. Knock, knock!

No one answered.

She pushed the door open and **stepped** inside.

"Hello?" she called. "Anyone home?"

The **room was** quiet. No one **was** there.

[She went inside! That's not polite!]

---

### Page 5
Goldilocks **looked** around the **room**. She saw three bowls of porridge on the table.

One big bowl. One medium bowl. One small bowl.

"Mmm, **food**!" said Goldilocks. "I am hungry!"

She **took** a **spoon** and tasted the porridge in the big bowl.

"Yuck! **Too** hot!" she said.

[Three bowls of porridge! She tastes the big one!]

---

### Page 6
Goldilocks tasted the porridge in the medium bowl.

"Yuck! **Too** cold!" she said.

Then she tasted the porridge in the small bowl.

"Mmm! This one is just right!" she said.

She ate it all up! **Soon** the small bowl **was** empty!

[The small bowl is just right! She ate it all!]

---

### Page 7
Goldilocks **looked** around the **room** some more. She saw three chairs.

One big chair. One medium chair. One small chair.

"I am tired," said Goldilocks. "I will sit down."

She sat in the big chair.

"**Too** hard!" she said.

[Three chairs! She tries the big one!]

---

### Page 8
Goldilocks sat in the medium chair.

"**Too** soft!" she said.

Then she sat in the small chair.

"This one is just right!" she said happily.

But then—CRACK! The chair broke! Goldilocks fell to the floor!

"Oops!" she said.

[The small chair broke! Crash!]

---

### Page 9
Goldilocks **stood** up. She **shook** herself off.

She **looked** around. She saw stairs.

"I wonder what is up there?" she thought.

She climbed the stairs. At the top, she found a bedroom with three beds!

One big bed. One medium bed. One small bed.

[Three beds upstairs!]

---

### Page 10
Goldilocks **was** **very** tired now.

She lay down on the big bed.

"**Too** hard!" she said.

She lay down on the medium bed.

"**Too** soft!" she said.

Then she lay down on the small bed.

"This one is just right!" she said.

And **soon**, Goldilocks **was** fast asleep!

[She fell asleep in Baby Bear's bed!]

---

### Page 11
Meanwhile, the three bears came home from their walk.

They walked into the **room**.

Papa Bear **looked** at his bowl. "Someone has been eating my porridge!" he said in his big, deep voice.

Mama Bear **looked** at her bowl. "Someone has been eating my porridge!" she said in her medium voice.

Baby Bear **looked** at his bowl. "Someone has been eating my porridge, and they ate it all up!" he cried in his small voice.

[The bears are home! They notice the porridge!]

---

### Page 12
Then Papa Bear **looked** at his chair. "Someone has been sitting in my chair!" he said.

Mama Bear **looked** at her chair. "Someone has been sitting in my chair!" she said.

Baby Bear **looked** at his chair. "Someone has been sitting in my chair, and they broke it!" he cried.

[Someone sat in the chairs!]

---

### Page 13
The three bears climbed the stairs. They went into the bed**room**.

Papa Bear **looked** at his bed. "Someone has been sleeping in my bed!" he said.

Mama Bear **looked** at her bed. "Someone has been sleeping in my bed!" she said.

Baby Bear **looked** at his bed. "Someone has been sleeping in my bed, and there she is!" he cried.

[They found Goldilocks!]

---

### Page 14
Goldilocks woke up! She saw three bears **looking** at her!

"Oh no!" she cried.

She jumped out of bed! She ran down the stairs! She ran out the door!

She ran and ran through the **wood** until she **was** far, far away!

And she never came back.

[Goldilocks ran away! She learned her lesson!]

---

### Page 15
The three bears **shook** their heads.

"What a strange morning!" said Mama Bear.

"I hope she learned not to go into someone else's house without asking!" said Papa Bear.

"I hope so **too**!" said Baby Bear.

And they sat down to make more porridge and fix Baby Bear's chair.

**THE END**

[The bears are safe! And Goldilocks learned a lesson!]
