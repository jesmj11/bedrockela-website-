## The Story

### Page 1
Once there **was** a man and a woman. They had very little **gold**. They lived in a small hut by the **road**.

One day, they found a **goose**.

"Let us keep it," said the woman. "We can sell its eggs."

[A goose! They found it by the road!]

---

### Page 2
The next morning, the woman went to check on the **goose**.

She gasped! There **was** an egg. But it **was** not white. It **was** **gold**!

"Look!" she cried. "A **golden** egg!"

They sold the **gold** egg. They bought food and a **new** **coat**.

[A golden egg! What a surprise!]

---

### Page 3
**Every** day, the **goose** laid one **golden** egg. Just one.

The man and woman would sell it. **Slowly**, they got more and more **gold**.

They bought **new** clothes. They fixed their hut. They had plenty to eat.

Life **was** good!

[One egg every day. Slow and steady!]

---

### Page 4
But soon, the man got greedy.

"We only get one egg a day!" he said. "That is too **slow**! I want all the **gold** at once!"

"Let's cut open the **goose**," he said. "All the **golden** eggs must be inside!"

The woman did not **know** if this **was** a good idea. But she agreed.

[Uh oh! This sounds like a bad idea!]

---

### Page 5
They caught the **goose**. They cut it open.

But inside? There **was** nothing. No **golden** eggs. Just an ordinary **goose**.

Now the **goose** **was** dead. It could not lay any more **golden** eggs. Not even one.

The man and woman had nothing. Their greed cost them everything.

[Oh no! What did they do?]

---

### Page 6
The man and woman sat by the **road**. They were sad.

"We should have been patient," said the woman. "We had one **golden** egg **every** day. Now we have none."

They learned a lesson that day:

**Don't be greedy. Be grateful for what you have.**

[What a sad ending! But they learned their lesson!]

---

### Page 7
If they had waited, the **goose** would have given them one **golden** egg **every** day.

**Slow** and steady is better than trying to get everything at once.

Greed can make you lose it all.

**THE END**

[Remember: Be patient and grateful!]
