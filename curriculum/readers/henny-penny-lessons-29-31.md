**The Problem:** Henny Penny panicked without checking!

**Questions:**
- Have YOU ever panicked about something that wasn't a big deal?
- What should Henny Penny have done FIRST? (Look at what fell on her!)
- Why is it important to CHECK before you panic?

| She told Turkey Lurkey | Turkey believed and came along |
| They all panicked | Foxy Loxy tried to trick them |

#### **Fact Check Practice**

Someone tells you:
- "There's a monster under your bed!" → **Check first!** (Look under bed)
- "Your shoe is untied!" → **Check first!** (Look at your shoes)
- "It's raining outside!" → **Check first!** (Look out window)
- "The sky is falling!" → **Check first!** (Look at what fell!)

**Don't just believe—CHECK!**

- One person is Henny Penny (gets bonked, yells "The sky is falling!")
- Others are Ducky, Goosey, Turkey (panic and run!)
- One person is Foxy Loxy (tries to trick them—sly voice!)
- Everyone runs, stops, finds the acorn
- Everyone laughs—we were silly!

Also: Henny Penny had **double letters** in her name! When you see LL or FF or SS, remember: two letters make ONE sound! Don't panic—just blend!
