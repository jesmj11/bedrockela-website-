## The Story

### Page 1
**Once** upon a **time**, there was a **poor** boy named Jack.

He **lived** on a small **farm** with his **mother**.

They were very **poor**.

All they had was one cow named Daisy.

"We have no money **left**," said **Mother**.  
"We must sell Daisy at the **market**."

Jack was sad, but he knew **Mother** was right.

[Look sad! We're so poor!]

---

### Page 2
The next **morning**, Jack **started** walking to **market**.

He led Daisy down the **road**.

"Goodbye, Daisy," he said sadly.

**Halfway** to **market**, Jack met an old man.

"**Where** are you going with that cow?" asked the man.

"To **market** to sell her," said Jack.

[Walk along! Halfway there!]

---

### Page 3
The old man smiled.

"I **will** **trade** you **something** **magic** for your cow!" he said.

He opened his hand.

In it were **five** colorful **beans**.

"**Magic beans**!" said the man.  
"**Plant** these, and **something** amazing **will** happen!"

Jack looked at the **beans**.

They **sparkled** and **shone**.

"OK!" said Jack. "It's a **deal**!"

[Beans sparkle! So shiny!]

---

### Page 4
Jack **traded** Daisy for the **beans**.

He ran **home**, excited.

"**Mother**! **Mother**! Look what I got!" he said.

He showed her the **beans**.

"**Beans**?!" **Mother** **shouted**.  
"You **traded** our cow for **beans**?!  
How could you be so foolish!"

She threw the **beans** out the window.

"Go to bed with no supper!" she said.

**Poor** Jack went to bed hungry and sad.

[Throw the beans! Out the window!]

---

### Page 5
The next **morning**, Jack woke up.

His room was **dark**.

"That's **strange**," he said.  
"It should be bright outside!"

He looked out the window.

He **couldn't** believe what he saw!

[Look out the window! GASP!]

---

### Page 6
A **GIANT** **beanstalk** had grown **overnight**!

It was so tall, it **reached** all the way to the **clouds**!

Its **leaves** blocked the sun!

"The **beans** **were magic** after all!" said Jack.

He ran **outside**.

"I must **climb** this **beanstalk**!" he said.

[Point UP! So tall! To the clouds!]

---

### Page 7
Jack began **climbing**.

Up, up, up he went!

He **climbed** and **climbed** and **climbed**.

At last, he **reached** the top!

He stepped onto a **cloud**.

"I'm in the sky!" said Jack.

[Climb! Up, up, up! So high!]

---

### Page 8
Jack saw a **huge** castle in the **clouds**.

"**Maybe** there's food **inside**!" said Jack.  
"I am so hungry!"

He walked to the **giant** **door**.

**Knock, knock, knock!**

A **giant** woman answered.

"**Please**, can I have **something** to eat?" asked Jack.

[Knock! Knock! Knock!]

---

### Page 9
"You must go **away**!" said the woman.  
"My husband is a **giant**!  
If he finds you, he **will** eat you!"

"**Please**!" said Jack. "I am so hungry!"

The woman felt sorry for him.

"**Come** **inside**, **quick**!" she said.  
"I **will** give you **breakfast**.  
But you must hide if my husband comes **home**!"

[Come inside! Quick! Hurry!]

---

### Page 10
The woman gave Jack **bread** and **milk**.

Jack was **eating** when—

**THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!**

The **castle** shook!

"My husband is **coming**!" **whispered** the woman.  
"**Hide**!"

Jack **jumped** **inside** the oven to hide.

[Hide! Quick! In the oven!]

---

### Page 11
The **giant** **came** **inside**.

He was **enormous**!

He **sniffed** the air.

"**FEE! FI! FO! FUM!**  
**I smell the blood of an Englishman!**  
**Be he alive or be he dead,**  
**I'll grind his bones to make my bread!**"

Jack trembled **inside** the oven!

[Say it loud! FEE FI FO FUM!]

---

### Page 12
"There's no one here, dear," said the **giant's wife**.  
"You are just smelling your **breakfast**."

The **giant** sat down to eat.

After **breakfast**, he took out a bag of **gold** coins.

He counted them:  
"One, two, **three**, four, **five**..."

**Then** he fell **asleep**.

**SNORE! SNORE! SNORE!**

[Count coins! Then snore! SNORE!]

---

### Page 13
Jack peeked out of the oven.

The **giant** was **sleeping**!

Jack **quietly** **climbed** out.

He saw the bag of **gold** coins.

"This **gold** could help **Mother** and me!" he thought.

He **grabbed** the bag.

**Then** he ran for the **door**!

[Sneak! Grab the gold! Run!]

---

### Page 14
Jack ran to the **beanstalk**.

He **climbed** down as **fast** as he could!

Down, down, down!

At last, he **reached** the **ground**!

"**Mother**! **Mother**! Look!" he **shouted**.

He showed her the **gold** coins.

"**Where** did you get these?" she asked.

Jack told her **everything**.

[Climb down! Fast, fast, fast!]

---

### Page 15
"The **beans** **were magic**!" said Jack.  
"And there's **more** up there!  
I **will** go back **again**!"

"No, Jack!" said **Mother**. "It's too dangerous!"

But the next day, Jack **climbed** the **beanstalk** **again**.

This **time**, he wanted the **golden** goose!

[Climb again! Back up the beanstalk!]

---

### Page 16
Jack **reached** the **castle** **again**.

He **knocked** on the **door** **again**.

The **giant's wife** answered.

"You!" she said. "You **stole** my husband's **gold**!"

"**Please**!" said Jack. "I am so hungry!"

**Once** **again**, she **let** him **inside**.

"But if my husband finds you, I **can't** **help** you!"

[Knock again! Please let me in!]

---

### Page 17
Jack hid **inside** the oven **again**.

**THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!**

The **giant** **came** **home**!

"**FEE! FI! FO! FUM!**  
**I smell the blood of an Englishman!**"

"No one is here, dear," said his **wife**.

After **eating**, the **giant** took out a **golden** goose.

"Lay!" he commanded.

The goose laid a **golden** egg!

[The goose lays a GOLDEN egg!]

---

### Page 18
The **giant** fell **asleep** **again**.

**SNORE! SNORE! SNORE!**

Jack **grabbed** the **golden** goose and ran!

But the goose **squawked**!

"**SQUAWK! SQUAWK!**"

The **giant** woke up!

"**Stop**, thief!" he **roared**!

The **giant** **chased** Jack!

[SQUAWK! Wake up! Chase him!]

---

### Page 19
Jack ran to the **beanstalk**!

The **giant** was **right** behind him!

Jack **climbed** down as **fast** as he could!

The **giant** **started** **climbing** down **after** him!

The **beanstalk** shook!

"**Mother**!" **shouted** Jack. "Get the axe!"

[Climb! Fast! Giant is chasing!]

---

### Page 20
Jack **jumped** to the **ground**.

He **grabbed** the axe.

**CHOP! CHOP! CHOP!**

He **chopped** the **beanstalk**!

"**TIMBER**!" **shouted** Jack.

The **beanstalk** fell!

**CRASH!**

The **giant** fell back into the **clouds**.

Jack and **Mother** were **safe**!

[CHOP! CHOP! TIMBER! CRASH!]
