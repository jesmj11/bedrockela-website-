### Extension Activities

#### **Theme/Moral Discussion**
**The Lesson:** Even the smallest person can help the biggest person!

**Questions:**
- Have you ever helped someone bigger than you?
- Have you ever been helped by someone smaller?
- Does size matter when it comes to kindness?
- Can kids help grown-ups? How?

#### **Size Comparison**
- Lion = BIG
- Mouse = LITTLE
- But LITTLE mouse saved BIG lion!
- Find things that are big and little
- Talk about: biggest, bigger, big / littlest, littler, little

#### **Cause & Effect Chain**

| CAUSE | EFFECT |
|-------|--------|
| Mouse ran on lion | Lion woke up |
| Lion was about to eat mouse | Mouse begged to be freed |
| Lion let mouse go | Mouse was grateful |
| Lion got stuck in net | Lion roared for help |
| Mouse heard lion | Mouse came to help |
| Mouse chewed the net | Lion got free! |
| Mouse helped lion | They became best friends! |

**Big idea:** One ACT OF KINDNESS → Another act of kindness!

---

#### **Act It Out**
- One person is the big lion (use a deep voice, ROAR!)
- One person is the little mouse (use a tiny voice, squeak!)
- Act out the story with movements:
  - Lion sleeping (snore!)
  - Mouse running (scurry!)
  - Lion grabbing mouse (catch!)
  - Mouse begging (please!)
  - Lion laughing (ha ha!)
  - Lion stuck (pull, pull!)
  - Mouse nibbling (nibble nibble!)
  - Lion free (yay!)
  - Friends forever (hug!)

#### **Kindness Pays Off**
Talk about being kind:
- The lion was KIND to the mouse (let him go)
- The mouse was KIND to the lion (saved him)
- What KIND things can YOU do?
- Has someone been kind to you?
- How did it make you feel?

#### **Predictions Practice**
While reading, PAUSE and ask:
- "What do you think the lion will do to the mouse?"
- "Do you think the mouse can really help the lion? How?"
- "What do you think will happen when the lion gets stuck?"
- "Will the mouse remember his promise?"

#### **Compare to Other Stories**
- **Billy Goats Gruff:** Smallest goat went first, biggest saved the day
- **Lion & Mouse:** Smallest mouse saved the biggest lion
- **Connection:** Sometimes SMALL is MIGHTY!

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "I'm a small goat, but I can climb BIG mountains! You might be a small reader NOW, but you can read BIG books LATER! Just like the little mouse helped the big lion, YOU can do BIG things even when you're little! Never give up!"

Also: The lion LAUGHED at the mouse. But the mouse proved him wrong! Don't laugh at beginners—they might surprise you!
