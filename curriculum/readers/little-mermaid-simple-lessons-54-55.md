## The Story

### Page 1
**Far** down **under** the sea, there lived a little mermaid.

She had a beautiful tail and long hair. She lived with **her** **sisters** in a **pearl** palace.

The little mermaid loved to swim **over** coral reefs and through forests of sea **ferns**.

But **her** favorite thing **was** to swim to the surface and look at the **stars**.

[Under the sea! A mermaid with her sisters!]

---

### Page 2
One day, the little mermaid saw a ship on the **water** above.

She swam to the surface. She saw a prince on the ship! He **was** kind and handsome.

Suddenly, a **storm** came! The ship rocked! The prince fell into the **water**!

"I must help him!" cried the little mermaid.

[A prince! A storm! The prince is in danger!]

---

### Page 3
The little mermaid dove **under** the waves. She found the prince sinking down, down, down.

She grabbed him and pulled him up! She swam with him to the shore.

Then she swam away before he **woke** up.

[She saved him! The prince is safe!]

---

### Page 4
The little mermaid swam home. But she could not stop thinking about the prince.

"I want to see him again," she said. "I want to be **with** him **forever**."

"But I am a mermaid," she said sadly. "He is a human. We can **never** be together."

**Her** **sisters** tried to cheer **her** up. But the little mermaid **was** too sad.

[She loves the prince! But she's a mermaid!]

---

### Page 5
The little mermaid swam **far** from home. She found the sea witch.

"I want legs," said the little mermaid. "I want to walk on land and be with the prince."

The sea witch smiled. "I can help you," she said. "But there is a price."

[The sea witch! She can give the mermaid legs!]

---

### Page 6
"I will give you legs," said the witch. "But you must give me **your** voice."

"And remember," said the witch, "if the prince does not love you, you will **turn** into sea foam **forever**."

The little mermaid thought hard. She loved the prince so much.

"I will do it," she said.

[Giving up her voice! A big sacrifice!]

---

### Page 7
The sea witch gave the little mermaid a potion. She drank it.

**Her** tail began to change! It split into two legs!

But when she tried to speak, no sound came out. **Her** voice **was** gone.

The little mermaid swam to the surface. She climbed onto the shore.

[She has legs! But no voice!]

---

### Page 8
The little mermaid walked to the prince's castle. **Every** step **hurt**! It felt like walking on knives!

But she did not cry. She walked and walked.

The prince saw **her**. "Who are you?" he asked.

She could not answer. She had no voice.

[She can't tell him! She has no voice!]

---

### Page 9
The prince **was** kind. He let **her** stay at the castle.

The little mermaid danced **for** him. She smiled. She **was** with him, and that made **her** happy.

But the prince did not know she **was** the one who saved him. He did not know she loved him.

[She's with him! But he doesn't know the truth!]

---

### Page 10
One day, the prince told the little mermaid sad news.

"I must marry a princess from another land," he said. "My **father** says I must."

The little mermaid's heart broke. But still, she could not speak.

She danced at the prince's wedding. Tears filled **her** eyes.

[He's marrying someone else! The mermaid is heartbroken!]

---

### Page 11
That night, the little mermaid sat by the **water**. She **was** very sad.

**Her** **sisters** came up from the sea. "We have a way to save you!" they said.

"Take this knife. You must **hurt** the prince. Then you can be a mermaid again!"

But the little mermaid shook **her** head. She loved the prince. She would **never** **hurt** him.

[Her sisters want to help! But she won't hurt the prince!]

---

### Page 12
The little mermaid dropped the knife into the **water**. She looked at the **stars** one last time.

Then she began to **turn** into sea foam.

But instead of disappearing, she felt light! She **was** floating up, up, up!

Kind spirits of the air caught **her**. "You gave everything **for** love," they said. "You will live **forever** with us."
