## The Story

### Page 1
The Little Red Hen lived on a farm  
with a **lazy** cat,  
a **lazy** dog,  
and a **lazy** pig.

The Little Red Hen worked **hard** every day.

But the **other** animals did **nothing**!  
They just **napped** and **played**.

[Point to each lazy animal!]

---

### Page 2
One day, the Little Red Hen found some grains of wheat.

"Look!" she said. "I can **plant** these seeds  
and grow wheat!  
**Then** I can make **bread**!"

"That sounds like a **lot** of work," said the cat.  
And he went back to **sleep**.

[Yawn! Too much work!]

---

### Page 3
"**Who will help me plant the wheat**?" asked the Little Red Hen.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** cat.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** dog.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** pig.

[Say "NOT I!" in a lazy, bored voice!]

---

"**THEN I WILL DO IT MYSELF!**" said the Little Red Hen.

And she **did**.

She **planted** every seed.  
She **watered** them every day.  
She **pulled** the weeds.

It was **hard** work!

But the Little Red Hen did **not** give up.

[Pretend to dig and plant! Hard work!]

---

### Page 5
The wheat grew tall and **golden**.

The sun shone on it.  
The rain watered it.

Soon it was ready to **harvest**.

"**Who will help me cut the wheat**?" asked the Little Red Hen.

[Use a hopeful voice—maybe they'll help this time?]

She **cut** every stalk of wheat.

[Cut, cut, cut! More hard work!]

---

### Page 7
"**Who will help me thresh the wheat**?"  
asked the Little Red Hen.

(Threshing means separating the grains from the stalks!)

But she kept **working**.

[Whack the wheat! Tired but determined!]

---

(The mill is where wheat is ground into **flour**!)

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** cat.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** dog.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** pig.

[Still no help! So frustrating!]

And she **did**.

She **carried** the heavy sack of wheat  
all the way to the mill.

The miller ground it into **fine** white **flour**.

The Little Red Hen **carried** the **flour** back home.

[Carry the heavy sack! So heavy!]

asked the Little Red Hen.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** cat.

"**NOT I!**" said the **lazy** dog.

She **mixed** the **flour** with water.  
She **kneaded** the dough.  
She **shaped** it into a loaf.  
She **put** it in the **oven** to **bake**.

**All by herself!**

The **bread** was **baking**!

**Mmmmm!**

The cat **smelled** it.

They **all** came **running**!

[Sniff! Sniff! Smells SO good!]

The Little Red Hen took the **golden brown** loaf  
out of the **oven**.

It was **perfect**!

The cat came closer.  
The dog came closer.  
The pig came closer.

They were **drooling**!

[Come closer! Drool! Want that bread!]

---

"**WHO WILL HELP ME EAT THE BREAD?**"  
asked the Little Red Hen.

"**I WILL!**" said the cat.

"**I WILL!**" said the dog.

"**I WILL!**" said the pig.

[Say "I WILL!" eagerly! Now they want to help!]

---

### Page 16
The Little Red Hen looked at them.

Her eyes **narrowed**.

"**OH NO YOU WON'T!**" she said.

[Point your finger! OH NO YOU WON'T!]

"You did **NOT** help me **plant** the wheat!

You did **NOT** help me **cut** the wheat!

You did **NOT** help me **thresh** the wheat!

You did **NOT** help me **carry** it to the mill!

"**SO I WILL EAT THE BREAD MYSELF!**"  
said the Little Red Hen.

And she **did**!

She ate the **whole** loaf—  
every **delicious** bite!

**Yum! Yum! Yum!**

[Eat! Yum! So delicious!]

---

### Page 19
The cat, the dog, and the pig  
just **watched**.

They were **very** hungry.  
They were **very** sad.

They had **learned** a lesson:

**If you don't work,  
you don't eat!**

**The end!**

[Hang your heads! Learned a lesson!]

---

## Back Matter

### Expression Practice!

**This story is PERFECT for reading with FEELING!**

**Different voices to practice:**

1. **Little Red Hen (asking for help):** Hopeful, friendly  
   *"Who will help me plant the wheat?"*

2. **Lazy animals:** Bored, lazy, don't-care voice  
   *"NOT I!"* (yawn, stretch)

3. **Little Red Hen (doing work):** Determined, maybe a little frustrated  
   *"THEN I WILL DO IT MYSELF!"*

4. **Little Red Hen (angry at end):** VERY angry!  
   *"OH NO YOU WON'T!"*

5. **Eager animals:** Suddenly excited!  
   *"I WILL! I WILL!"* (too late!)

**Practice reading the SAME words with DIFFERENT feelings!**

---

### Punctuation Guides Your Voice!

**Notice the punctuation:**

- **!** (exclamation point) = Read with FEELING! Loud! Excited or angry!
- **?** (question mark) = Voice goes UP at the end (asking)
- **.** (period) = Normal voice, statement

**Examples:**
- "Not I**.**" (boring, flat)
- "Not I**!**" (stronger, more definite)
- "Who will help me**?**" (voice goes up—asking!)

---

### Repeated Phrases to Practice

"**Who will help me** _____?"  
"**NOT I!**" (said three times by three animals!)  
"**THEN I WILL DO IT MYSELF!**"  
"**I WILL!**" (eager animals)  
"**OH NO YOU WON'T!**"

**Challenge:** Can you say "NOT I!" in a LAZY voice?  
Can you say "I WILL!" in an EAGER voice?

---

**Arguments for FAIR:**

**Key moments to practice:**
1. Asking for help (hopeful!)

### Billy's Connection

Billy the Goat says: "The Little Red Hen did ALL the work and got ALL the reward! In reading, if YOU do the work (practice every day!), YOU get the reward (you can read ANYTHING!)! But if you're lazy and don't practice... well, you won't get to 'eat the bread' (enjoy great stories)! Put in the WORK!"

Also: Notice how the Little Red Hen's voice CHANGED through the story? At first hopeful, then frustrated, then ANGRY! That's expression! Your reading voice should CHANGE based on the character's feelings!
