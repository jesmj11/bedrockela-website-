### Extension Activities

#### **Sequence the Steps**
Put the steps in order! Draw or act them out:
1. Plant the seeds
2. Cut the wheat
3. Make the flour
4. Bake the bread
5. Eat the bread!

#### **Act It Out**
- One person is the Little Red Hen
- Three people are pig, cat, dog
- Act out each step!
- Say "Not I!" together
- Say "Then I will!" firmly
- Pretend to eat at the end!

#### **Work vs. Lazy Chart**

| Little Red Hen (WORKED) | Pig, Cat, Dog (LAZY) |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Planted seeds | Took a nap |
| Cut the wheat | Played |
| Made flour | Did nothing |
| Baked bread | Watched |
| Got to eat! | Did NOT get to eat! |

**Question:** Who made better choices?

---

#### **Cause & Effect**
- CAUSE: Friends didn't help → EFFECT: They didn't get to eat
- CAUSE: Hen did all the work → EFFECT: She got all the bread!
- CAUSE: Seeds were planted → EFFECT: Wheat grew
- CAUSE: Wheat was baked → EFFECT: Delicious bread!

**Big Lesson:** If you don't work, you don't eat! (Consequences!)

---

#### **Fairness Discussion**
- Was it FAIR that the hen didn't share?
- Was it FAIR that the animals didn't help?
- What would YOU do?
- If you help, should you get a reward?
- If you DON'T help, should you still get a reward?

#### **Helping at Home**
Talk about helping:
- What chores do you do at home?
- How do you help your family?
- What happens if no one helps?
- How does it feel when everyone works together?

#### **Make "Bread" Together**
- Real recipe: Make simple bread or playdough
- Pretend recipe: Use blocks to "build" a loaf
- Practice sequence: First... Next... Then... Last...

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "Climbing the reading mountain takes WORK! You can't take a nap like the lazy pig and expect to reach the top! The Little Red Hen worked hard, and SHE got the bread. YOU work hard at reading, and YOU will get to enjoy great stories!"

Also: The Little Red Hen did things in ORDER—plant, cut, grind, bake. Reading has an order too! Learn sounds first, then blend them, then read words, then sentences, then stories!
