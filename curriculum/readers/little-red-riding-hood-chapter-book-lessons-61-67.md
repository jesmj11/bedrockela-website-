## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

### Page 1
**Once** upon a time, there was a **little** girl  
who lived in a **village** near the woods.

Everyone called her **Little** Red Riding Hood  
because she always **wore** a red cape with a hood.

Her **grandmother** **made** it for her,  
and it was her favorite thing to **wear**.

[Point to your hood! Little Red Riding Hood!]

---

### Page 2
One day, **Little** Red's mother said,

"Your **grandmother** is sick.  
Can you take this **basket** of food to her?  
She lives on the other side of the woods."

"Yes, Mother!" said **Little** Red.  
"I will go right away!"

Mother packed the **basket** with:  
- **Bread**
- **Butter**  
- A **slice** of **cake**
- Some fresh **eggs**

[Pack the basket! Bread, butter, cake, eggs!]

---

### Page 3
"Now listen," said Mother.

"Stay on the **pathway**.  
**Don't** talk to strangers.  
Go straight to **Grandmother's** house.  
**Don't** stop in the woods!"

"I **won't**, Mother!" said **Little** Red.  
"I **promise**!"

She put on her red hood,  
picked up the **basket**,  
and headed into the woods.

[Wave goodbye! Off to Grandma's house!]

---

### Page 4
The woods were beautiful.

**Little** Red walked along the **pathway**.

She saw:  
- Birds singing in the trees  
- Flowers growing by the **edge** of the path  
- Butterflies dancing in the air

"What a **nice** day!" said **Little** Red.

She hummed a **little** song as she walked.

[Hum a happy tune! La la la!]

---

### Page 5
Suddenly, a **big**, **gray** wolf stepped onto the **pathway**!

"Good morning, **little** girl," said the wolf  
in a **gentle** **voice**.

**Little** Red stopped.

She **knew** she should **not** talk to strangers.

But the wolf seemed **nice**...

**Wrong** choice, **Little** Red!

[Wolf appears! Use a sneaky voice!]

---

### Page 6
"**Where** are you going?" asked the wolf.

"To my **grandmother's** house," said **Little** Red.  
"She lives on the other side of the woods.  
She is sick, so I am bringing her food."

"How **nice** of you!" said the wolf.

But inside, he was thinking:  
*"Mmm! A **little** girl AND her **grandmother**!  
I **could** eat them both!"*

[Wolf is thinking sneaky thoughts!]

---

### Page 7
"**Why** **don't** you pick some flowers for your **grandmother**?"  
said the wolf.

"Look! There are beautiful flowers over there  
by that **hedge**!"

"Oh! Good idea!" said **Little** Red.

She left the **pathway**  
and went to pick flowers.

**Wrong** again, **Little** Red!

[Pick flowers! But uh oh... wrong choice!]

---

### Page 8
As soon as **Little** Red left the **pathway**,  
the wolf ran ahead!

He **knew** a **quick** **shortcut** through the woods.

"I will get to **Grandmother's** house first!" he said.  
"**Then** I will eat **Grandmother**,  
and **when** **Little** Red arrives,  
I will eat her too!"

The wolf laughed his wicked laugh.

**Chapter 1 ends here!**  
**What will happen next?**

[Wolf runs ahead! Oh no!]

---

## Chapter 2: At Grandmother's House

### Page 9
The wolf arrived at **Grandmother's** little house.

**Knock, knock, knock!**

(Remember: **knock** has a **silent K**!)

"**Who** is there?" called **Grandmother** from **inside**.

"It's me, **Little** Red!" said the wolf  
in a high, fake **voice**.

(He was trying to **trick** **Grandmother**!)

[Knock! Knock! Knock! Use a high fake voice!]

---

### Page 10
"The door is unlocked, dear," said **Grandmother**.  
"Come **inside**!"

The wolf opened the door and went **inside**.

**Poor Grandmother**!

She was lying in bed.  
She was old and weak.

When she saw the wolf,  
she tried to scream—

But it was too late!

[Gasp! The wolf is inside!]

---

### Page 11
The wolf gobbled up **Grandmother**  
in one big gulp!

**(Don't worry—in the real story, she's OK later!)**

**Then** the wolf put on **Grandmother's** nightgown.

He put on her nightcap.

He put on her **glasses**.

He climbed into her bed  
and pulled up the covers.

"Now I will wait for **Little** Red!" he said.

[Wolf dresses up like Grandma! Sneaky!]

---

### Page 12
Meanwhile, **Little** Red was still picking flowers.

She picked:  
- **White** daisies  
- Yellow buttercups  
- Purple **violets**

She **made** a beautiful **bouquet**.

"**Grandmother** will love these!" she said.

**Then** she remembered:  
"Oh! I should hurry!  
Mother said **not** to stop in the woods!"

She ran back to the **pathway**  
and hurried to **Grandmother's** house.

[Pick flowers! Run back to the path!]

---

### Page 13
At last, **Little** Red arrived at the little house.

**Knock, knock, knock!**

"**Who** is there?" called a **voice** from **inside**.

(It was the wolf's **voice**,  
but **Little** Red **didn't** know that!)

"It's me, **Little** Red!" she said.

"Come **inside**, dear!" said the **voice**.

**Little** Red opened the door and went in.

[Knock knock! Go inside!]

---

### Page 14
The room was dark.

**Little** Red walked to the bed.

She could see someone under the covers.

"Hello, **Grandmother**!" said **Little** Red.  
"I brought you food and flowers!"

"Thank you, dear," said the wolf  
in his fake old-woman **voice**.  
"Come closer so I can see you!"

**Little** Red came closer.

**Chapter 2 ends here!**  
**What will Little Red notice?**

[Come closer to the bed... closer...]

---

## Chapter 3: Something Is Wrong!

### Page 15
**Little** Red looked at "**Grandmother**."

Something was **wrong**.

"**Grandmother**," she said,  
"**What** big ears you have!"

"The **better** to hear you with, my dear!"  
said the wolf.

**Little** Red came a **little** closer.

[Look carefully! Something's not right!]

---

### Page 16
"**Grandmother**," said **Little** Red,  
"**What** big **eyes** you have!"

"The **better** to see you with, my dear!"  
said the wolf.

**Little** Red felt nervous.

She took a step back.

[Step back! This is weird!]

---

### Page 17
"**Grandmother**," said **Little** Red,  
"**What** big **teeth** you have!"

The wolf **grinned** a big, **wicked** grin.

"The **better** to EAT you with!"  
he **roared**!

And he **jumped** out of bed!

**Little** Red **screamed**!

"HELP! HELP! It's a WOLF!"

[ROAR! Jump! SCREAM! Help!]

---

### Page 18
The wolf **chased** **Little** Red around the room!

She ran behind the table!  
She ran behind the chair!

"Help! **Someone** help me!" she cried.

The wolf was **fast**!

He was getting closer and closer!

**Little** Red was in terrible danger!

**Chapter 3 ends here!**  
**Will someone save her?**

[Run! Chase around the room!]

---

## Chapter 4: The Rescue!

### Page 19
Just **then**—

A **woodcutter** was walking by **outside**!

(A **woodcutter** is someone **who** cuts down trees.  
**Woodcutter** is a **compound word**:  
wood + cutter = **woodcutter**!)

He heard **Little** Red **screaming**!

"That sounds like trouble!" he said.

He ran to the house with his **axe**!

[Woodcutter runs! To the rescue!]

---

### Page 20
The **woodcutter** burst through the door!

He saw the wolf **chasing** **Little** Red!

"Stop right there, wolf!" he **shouted**.

The wolf turned around.

When he saw the **big** **woodcutter** with the **big** **axe**,  
the wolf got **scared**!

"Uh oh!" said the wolf.

[Woodcutter bursts in! Stop, wolf!]

---

### Page 21
The wolf tried to run away!

But the **woodcutter** was **quick**!

He **caught** the wolf!

"Spit out **Grandmother**, you **wicked** wolf!"  
said the **woodcutter**.

The wolf had to spit out **Grandmother**.

She was OK! (A **little** wet, but OK!)

[Spit her out! She's OK!]

---

### Page 22
The **woodcutter** **chased** the wolf out of the house.

"Get out of here!" he **shouted**.  
"And **don't** come back!"

The wolf ran into the woods as **fast** as he could.

He **never** came back.

**Little** Red and **Grandmother** were **safe**!

[Wolf runs away! Don't come back!]

---

### Page 23
"Thank you for saving us!" said **Little** Red.

"You are very **brave**!" said **Grandmother**.

"I am just glad you are both **safe**!" said the **woodcutter**.

**Grandmother** got out of bed.

**Little** Red unpacked the **basket** of food.

They all sat down and had a **nice** meal together.

[Sit down! Eat together! Safe and happy!]

---

### Page 24
After the meal, the **woodcutter** walked **Little** Red **home**.

When they arrived, Mother was so happy to see her!

"Did you stay on the **pathway**?" asked Mother.

**Little** Red hung her head.

"No, Mother," she said. "I **didn't**.  
I talked to the wolf.  
I left the **pathway** to pick flowers.  
I'm sorry. I **shouldn't** have done that."

[Hang your head. I made mistakes.]

---

### Page 25
"I'm just glad you're **safe**," said Mother.

"I learned my lesson!" said **Little** Red.

"From now on, I **will**:
- Stay on the **pathway**
- **Not** talk to strangers
- **Listen** to what you say!"

"That's my **smart** girl!" said Mother.

And **Little** Red **never** went into the woods alone again.

**The lesson:**

**Listen** to good advice!  
Stay **safe**!  
**Don't** talk to strangers!

**THE END!**

[Smile! Happy, safe ending!]

**Act it out** with different voices!

---

#### **Predictions Review**

At the end of each chapter, we asked: "What will happen next?"

- Did you think the wolf would eat Grandma? ✓
- Did you think Little Red would notice something wrong? ✓
- Did you think someone would save them? ✓

**Good readers make predictions!**

There are many versions of this story!

**In some versions:**

- wood + cutter = **woodcutter**
- some + one = **someone**
- out + side = **outside**
- in + side = **inside**

**Make your own!** bed + room = bedroom, sun + shine = sunshine...

---

#### **Billy's Connection**

Billy the Goat says: "Little Red Riding Hood read a CHAPTER BOOK and so did YOU! This is a HUGE milestone in your reading journey! Just like Little Red had to navigate a dangerous path through the woods, you're navigating the reading mountain. And look—you made it through ALL FOUR CHAPTERS! You're amazing!"
