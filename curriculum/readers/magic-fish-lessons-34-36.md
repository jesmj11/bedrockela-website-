## The Story

### Page 1
Once upon a *time*, a man lived in a small hut by the sea. He had a **wife**. They had very little.

Each day, the man would fish. He would **make** a catch and they would eat. Their **life** was simple and quiet.

[Point to each magic e word. What makes the vowel say its name?]

---

### Page 2
One day, the man felt a tug on his line. He pulled and pulled. Up came a big **fish**!

But this was not just any fish. It could talk!

"Please, let me go!" said the **fish**. "I am a **magic** fish. I can grant a **wish**!"

[Use a special voice for the magic fish!]

---

### Page 3
The man was kind. "I do not need a **wish**," he said. "You may go."

He let the **fish** swim away. **Waves** splashed as it dove back into the sea.

The man went home. He told his **wife** the story.

[Act out releasing the fish. Splash your hands like waves!]

---

### Page 4
"What?" cried his **wife**. "You let it go? You did not **make** a **wish**?"

"We are **fine**," said the man. "We have all we need."

"Go back!" said his **wife**. "Ask for a nice home. This hut is too small!"

[Use an upset voice for the wife!]

---

### Page 5
The man went back to the sea. He called:

**"Fish, fish, in the sea,
My wife made a wish for me!"**

The **fish** came up from the **waves**.

"What does she wish?" asked the **fish**.

"A nice home," said the man.

[Say the magic rhyme together!]

---

### Page 6
"Go back. You will see," said the **fish**.

The man went home. The little hut was gone! In its **place** stood a fine home with a **gate** and a **path**.

His **wife** was happy. For a while.

[What happened? The fish used its magic!]

---

### Page 7
But soon, the **wife** wanted more.

"Go back to the **fish**!" she said. "Ask for a **palace**! I want to be queen!"

The man did not want to. But he went to the sea. He called:

**"Fish, fish, in the sea,
My wife made a wish for me!"**

[How does the man feel? Is he happy about this?]

---

### Page 8
The **fish** came up. "What does she wish now?"

"She wants to be queen," said the man. "She wants a **palace**."

"Go back. You will see," said the **fish**.

The man went home. A huge **palace** stood in **place** of the home! His **wife** wore a crown and sat on a throne.

[Use your hands to show how BIG the palace is!]

---

### Page 9
But the **wife** still wanted more.

"Go back!" she said. "I want to rule the sun and the moon! I want to tell *them* when to **rise**!"

The man was sad. But he went to the sea one more **time**. **Waves** were tall and dark. The sky was gray.

He called:

**"Fish, fish, in the sea,
My wife made a wish for me!"**

[The weather is changing. What does that mean?]

---

### Page 10
The **fish** came up. The water was wild.

"What does she wish *this* **time**?" asked the **fish**.

"She... she wants to rule the sun and the moon," the man said quietly.

The **fish** was silent. Then it said, "Go back. You will see."

[Do you think the fish will grant this wish?]

---

### Page 11
The man went home. The **palace** was gone! The **fine** home was gone!

There was only the little hut, just as before.

His **wife** sat inside. She had no crown. She had no throne.

They were back where they started.

[What happened? Why did everything disappear?]

---

### Page 12
And that is where they stayed.

The man went fishing each day. They ate what he caught. They had very little, just like before.

But they learned a lesson: Be happy with what you have.

[Did they learn their lesson?]
