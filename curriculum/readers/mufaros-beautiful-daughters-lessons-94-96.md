# Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters
## Lessons 94-96 - Character Feelings & Comparison

**African Folktale from Zimbabwe**

Mufaro had two beautiful daughters: Nyasha (kind) and Manyara (mean).

**Nyasha's feelings:** Happy, content, kind to everyone. She sang to her garden plants and fed a hungry snake.

**Manyara's feelings:** Jealous, angry, selfish. She wanted to be queen and was mean to Nyasha.

The king wanted a wife. Both sisters traveled to meet him.

Along the way, Manyara was rude to an old woman and a hungry boy. Nyasha was kind to both.

At the palace, Manyara met a terrible snake and ran away, screaming!

Nyasha entered and saw the snake she had fed! It transformed into the KING! He had tested them.

"You were kind when you thought no one important was watching," said the king. "Will you be my queen?"

Nyasha said yes! Manyara became a servant in the palace.

**Character Comparison:**
- Nyasha: Kind, patient, humble → Became QUEEN!
- Manyara: Mean, impatient, proud → Became SERVANT!

**Lesson:** How you treat others shows who you REALLY are! Kindness wins!
