## The Story

### Page 1
One day, the **North** Wind and the Sun had an argument.

"I am stronger than you!" said the **North** Wind.

"No, I am stronger!" said the Sun.

"Let's have a contest!" said the **North** Wind.

"Whoever can make that **farmer** take off his coat  
will win!"

"Deal!" said the Sun.

[Point! There's the farmer!]

---

### Page 2
The **farmer** was walking down the road.

He **wore** a thick **warm** coat.

"Watch me!" said the **North** Wind.  
"I will make him take off his coat!"

The **North** Wind began to blow.

**WHOOOOSH!**

[Blow like the wind! WHOOOOSH!]

---

### Page 3
The **North** Wind blew **hard**.

**WHOOOOSH! WHOOOOSH!**

But the **farmer** just pulled his coat tighter.

"It's cold!" said the **farmer**.  
"I need my coat!"

The **North** Wind blew **harder**!

**WHOOOOOOOOSH!**

[Blow HARDER! Whoooosh!]

---

### Page 4
The **North** Wind blew and blew.

He blew so **hard** that a **storm** came!

**Dark** clouds filled the sky.

The **farmer** held his coat even tighter.

"This **storm** is terrible!" said the **farmer**.  
"I must keep my coat on  
**or** I will freeze!"

The **North** Wind blew until he was tired.

[Huff and puff! So tired!]

---

### Page 5
At last, the **North** Wind stopped.

He was tired.

"I could **not** make him take off his coat!" he said.

"You used too much **force**," said the Sun.  
"Now it is my turn.  
Watch me!"

[Sun smiles! My turn now!]

---

### Page 6
The Sun began to shine.

**Gently**.  
**Warmly**.

The **farmer** looked up at the sky.

"Oh!" he said.  
"The **storm** is **over**!  
The Sun is out!  
It feels **warm**!"

[Shine gently! Feel the warm sun!]

---

### Page 7
The Sun shone a little **more**.

It got **warmer** and **warmer**.

"It's getting hot!" said the **farmer**.

He unbuttoned his coat.

But he did **not** take it off yet.

[Unbutton the coat! Getting warm!]

---

### Page 8
The Sun shone even **more**.

Now it was very **warm**!

"I'm so hot!" said the **farmer**.

He took off his coat!

"That's **better**!" he said.

He put his coat **over** his **arm**  
and kept walking.

[Take off the coat! Ahhhh! So much better!]

---

### Page 9
The Sun smiled.

"I won!" said the Sun.

The **North** Wind was quiet.

"You see," said the Sun,  
"**Warm** kindness works **better**  
than cold **force**.

Being gentle is **stronger**  
than being **hard**!"

**The lesson:**

Gentleness and kindness  
work **better** than **force**!

**The end!**

[Sun wins! Gentle is better than harsh!]

## Back Matter

### R-Controlled Vowel Practice

**AR words:** **ar**m, **far**mer, h**ar**d, h**ar**der, w**ar**m, w**ar**mer, m**ar**ch, d**ar**k, st**ar**t, p**ar**t  

**OR words:** N**or**th, **or**, st**or**m, sh**or**t, f**or**ce, bef**or**e, m**or**e, c**or**ner, w**or**e, w**or**n  

**ER words:** **ov**er, **aft**er, **und**er, **nev**er, **ev**er, **bett**er, h**er**  

**"Bossy R" Rule:** When a vowel is followed by R, the R changes the sound!
- AR says /ar/ like in "car"
- OR says /or/ like in "for"
- ER says /er/ like in "her"

**AR Practice Sentence:**  
"The **far**mer walked **far** from the b**ar**n in the **dar**k with h**ar**d shoes on!"

**OR Practice Sentence:**  
"The N**or**th wind blew bef**or**e the st**or**m with f**or**ce **or** m**or**e!"

**ER Practice Sentence:**  
"The Sun is **bett**er than **ev**er when it shines **ov**er h**er** aft**er** the st**or**m!"

**Which is BETTER?** Kindness!

**Questions:**

- Which way do YOU want to treat people?

#### **Billy's Connection**

Billy the Goat says: "When learning to read gets HARD, don't be harsh on yourself like the North Wind! Be WARM and gentle like the Sun! If you're kind to yourself and keep trying GENTLY, you'll learn BETTER than if you get mad and frustrated! Gentle practice works better than forcing it!"

Also: The Sun won by being SMART, not by being HARSH. In reading, work SMARTER, not HARDER! Use tricks like R-controlled vowels to make reading EASIER!
