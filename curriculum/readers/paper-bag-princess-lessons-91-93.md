# The Paper Bag Princess
## Lessons 91-93 - Story Structure & Author's Purpose

**Beginning:** Princess Elizabeth was beautiful and engaged to Prince Ronald. A dragon burned her castle, took her clothes, and kidnapped Ronald! Elizabeth wore a paper bag and chased the dragon.

**Middle:** Elizabeth tricked the dragon! "Can you burn forests?" The dragon did. "Can you fly around the world?" The dragon did—and got tired! The dragon fell asleep, exhausted.

**End (SURPRISING!):** Elizabeth rescued Ronald. But he said, "You're a mess! Come back when you look like a princess!" Elizabeth said, "You look like a prince, but you ACT like a toad! I'm not marrying you!" And she skipped away, happy.

**Author's Purpose:** Show that princesses don't need princes to rescue them—they can rescue THEMSELVES! Being brave and smart matters more than fancy clothes!

**Story Structure:** Problem (dragon took prince) → Middle (princess solves it) → Resolution (surprising twist—she doesn't want him!)

**Theme:** Girl power! Intelligence beats strength! Don't judge by appearance!
