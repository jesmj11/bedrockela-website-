# Rumpelstiltskin
## Lessons 106-108 - Context Clues & Prefixes

A poor miller lied to the king: "My daughter can spin straw into gold!" The king locked her in a room full of straw. "Spin this into gold by morning or die!"

She cried. A strange little man appeared. "I'll help you—for your necklace!" He spun the straw into gold!

The king wanted MORE. The little man helped again—for her ring.

The king said, "Spin one more time and I'll make you queen!" The little man appeared. "I'll help—but you must give me your first child!"

She was **un**happy but agreed. (**Un-** = not)

She became queen and had a baby. The little man **re**turned! (**Re-** = again)

"Please! Take anything else!" she begged.

"Fine. Guess my name in three days!"

She sent messengers to find **un**usual names. (**Un-** = not usual)

On the third day, a messenger heard the little man singing: "My name is RUMPELSTILTSKIN!"

When the queen guessed correctly, Rumpelstiltskin stomped so hard he fell through the floor!

**Context Clues:**
- "Spin straw into gold" = (Context: straw is plant material, gold is valuable metal—turning one into the other is magic!)
- What does "stomped" mean? (Context: he was angry, fell through floor—must mean hitting the ground hard with feet!)

**Prefix Practice:**
- **Un**happy = not happy
- **Re**turned = came back again
- **Un**usual = not usual/normal
