## The Story

### Page 1
Once upon a time, there **was** a shoemaker. He **was** **very** poor.

He had just enough leather to make one pair of shoes. Just one.

"This is **my** last bit of leather," he said sadly. "I will **try** to make one more pair. Then I will have no more."

[The shoemaker is poor. He's very sad!]

---

### Page 2
That night, the shoemaker cut the leather. He laid it on his workbench.

"I am too tired to finish," he said. "I will sew the shoes in the morning."

He went to bed. His wife did too.

The workshop **was** dark and quiet.

[He leaves the leather on the bench. What will happen?]

---

### Page 3
In the morning, the shoemaker went to his bench.

He gasped!

The shoes were done! And they were perfect! **Shiny** and **pretty**!

"Who did this?" he cried. "These are the most **pretty** shoes I have ever seen! **Very** fine work!"

[Someone made the shoes! But who?]

---

### Page 4
A rich man came into the shop. He saw the **shiny** shoes.

"These are beautiful!" he said. "I will buy them!"

He paid the shoemaker well. **Very** well!

Now the shoemaker had money to buy leather for two more pairs!

"**My** luck is changing!" he said **happily**.

[The shoes sold! The shoemaker is happy now!]

---

### Page 5
That night, the shoemaker cut leather for two pairs of shoes. He left the pieces on his bench.

"I will sew them in the morning," he said.

But in the morning, both pairs were done! **Shiny** and perfect!

"This is **very** strange!" said his wife. "Who is helping us?"

[It happened again! Who is doing this?]

---

### Page 6
The shoes sold quickly. The shoemaker bought leather for four more pairs.

Again, he cut the leather at night. Again, he left it on the bench.

In the morning, all four pairs were done! **Very** **pretty** and **shiny**!

"We must find out who is helping us!" said the shoemaker.

[Four pairs this time! The mystery continues!]

---

### Page 7
That night, the shoemaker and his wife hid. They wanted to **spy**!

They waited. The workshop **was** dark and still.

Then, at midnight, **tiny** elves appeared! Two of them!

They were **very** small. They wore rags. They had no shoes!

[Tiny elves! Two of them! And they're barefoot!]

---

### Page 8
The **tiny** elves jumped onto the bench. They worked **very** fast!

Tap-tap-tap! Stitch-stitch-stitch!

Their hands flew! They sewed and hammered. **By** morning, all the shoes were done!

Then the elves ran away and hid.

"Those **tiny** elves helped us!" whispered the wife. "They work so hard! But they have no shoes!"

[The elves are SO fast! And they have no shoes of their own!]

---

### Page 9
The shoemaker and his wife felt **very** grateful.

"Let's make them a gift!" said the wife. "They have been so kind!"

So the shoemaker made two **tiny** pairs of shoes. **Very** small! Perfect for elf feet!

The wife sewed two **tiny** outfits. **Pretty** shirts and pants.

They laid the gifts on the bench.

[Gifts for the elves! Tiny shoes and clothes!]

---

### Page 10
That night, the elves came back. They saw the **tiny** shoes and clothes!

They were **very** **happy**! They clapped and danced!

They put on their new clothes and shoes. They looked so **shiny** and **pretty**!

They danced around the workshop. Then they flew out the window!

[The elves are so happy! They're dancing!]

---

### Page 11
The elves never came back. But the shoemaker did not mind.

He had learned to make shoes **very** well **by** watching the elves!

His shop did well. He and his wife were never poor again.

And they were always kind to others, just as the elves had been kind to them.

[The elves taught them! Kindness pays forward!]

---

### Page 12
**THE END**

Kindness brings **happiness**!

The **tiny** elves helped the shoemaker. The shoemaker helped the elves.

Everyone was **happy**!

[A very happy ending!]
