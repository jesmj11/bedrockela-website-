- **Wife:** Say "Shhhh! Hush!" and hide
- Everyone can take turns being each character!

- **Connection:** Helping each other is best!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "Sometimes reading feels like hard work, like making shoes stitch by stitch. But when you practice every night (like the elves came every night!), you wake up and you're BETTER! Magic happens when you practice!"

Also: The shoemaker said "THANK YOU" by making gifts. Say THANK YOU to people who help you learn to read!
