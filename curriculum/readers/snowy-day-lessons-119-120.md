# The Snowy Day
## Lessons 119-120 - Time Words & Feelings

**One winter morning**, Peter woke up. Snow had fallen! He put on his snowsuit and went **outside**.

**First**, he made tracks **with** his feet. **Then** he dragged a stick. **After that**, he made angels.

He packed a snowball **for later** and put it in his pocket.

**At lunchtime**, he went **inside**. **While** he ate, he told his mother about his day.

**In the afternoon**, he went back **outside**. He climbed a snowy mountain and slid down!

**Before dinner**, he came **inside**. He remembered the snowball! But it had melted—his pocket was wet!

**That night** **before** bed, he felt sad about the snowball. But he was happy about tomorrow's snow.

**The next morning**, new snow had fallen! Peter called his friend. **Soon** they were playing together!
