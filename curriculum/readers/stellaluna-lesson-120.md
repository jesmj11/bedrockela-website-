# Stellaluna - Unit 3 Finale!
## Lesson 120 - All Skills Review & Theme

**🎊 UNIT 3 COMPLETE! 🎊**

Stellaluna was a baby fruit bat who lived with her mother in the forest.

An owl attacked! Stellaluna fell and landed in a bird's nest. The mother bird took her in.

"You can stay, but you must act like a bird," said Mother Bird. Stellaluna tried:
- Eating bugs (yuck!)
- Sleeping head-up (uncomfortable!)
- Flying during the day (so bright!)

She tried to fit in, even though it felt wrong.

One day, Stellaluna flew at night and found other bats! Her mother found her! "You're a BAT!" her mother said, hugging her.

Stellaluna brought her bird friends to meet the bats. The birds tried hanging upside-down but fell!

"How can we be so different and feel so much the same?" asked Stellaluna.

"You are my friend," said the bird. "That's what matters."

**Comprehension Skills Review:**
- **Character development:** Stellaluna changes from confused → trying to fit in → discovering who she is → accepting differences
- **Theme:** Being different is OK! Friendship works across differences! Be yourself!
- **Compare/contrast:** Bats vs. birds (both fly, both have friends, but different habits!)
- **Text-to-text connection:** Like The Ugly Duckling! Both about being different and finding where you belong!
- **Problem/solution:** Problem (doesn't fit in with birds) → Solution (finds other bats, learns being different is OK)

**Author's Purpose:** Teach that you can be friends with people who are different from you! Celebrate differences!

**Emotional Arc:** Lost → Confused → Trying to fit in → Finding identity → Accepting self AND others
