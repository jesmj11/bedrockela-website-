## Back Matter

### Magic E Practice: ALL VOWELS!

**A_E words:** **m**a**de**, **c**a**me**, **g**a**ve**, **t**a**ke**, **t**a**ste**, **pl**a**ce**, **s**a**me**, **n**a**me**, **s**a**fe**, **pl**a**tes**  
**I_E words:** **n**i**ce**, **t**i**me**  
**O_E words:** **st**o**ne**, **h**o**me**, **b**o**ne**, **th**o**se**, **cl**o**se**, **al**o**ne**  
**U_E words:** **r**u**de**, **h**u**ge**, **c**u**te**, **u**se**  
**E_E words:** (th**e**se - silent e at end doesn't make long e, but good to notice!)

**Magic E Rule:** When a word has a vowel, then a consonant, then an E at the end, the E is SILENT and makes the vowel say its NAME!

**Examples:**
- **can** → **cane** (short a → long a)
- **hop** → **hope** (short o → long o)
- **cut** → **cute** (short u → long u)

**Practice Sentence:**  
"They **came** to the village and **made** **stone** soup in a **huge** pot at the **same** **place** near my **home**!"

### Extension Activities

#### **The Magic of Sharing!**

**At the beginning:**
- Villagers were SELFISH (wouldn't share)
- Travelers were ALONE and HUNGRY
- Everyone was SEPARATE

**At the end:**
- Villagers SHARED what they had
- Everyone ATE TOGETHER
- They became FRIENDS!

**Question:** What changed? (They learned to SHARE and work TOGETHER!)

---

#### **Sequence the Ingredients**

Put the ingredients in order!
1. Stone (first!)
2. Onion
3. Carrot
4. Potatoes (five!)
5. Bone
6. Cabbage, beans, tomatoes, celery, spices

**Make your own stone soup!** What would YOU add?

---

#### **Cause & Effect**

| CAUSE | EFFECT |
|-------|--------|
| Travelers asked for food | Villagers said NO |
| Travelers said "stone soup" | Villagers got curious |
| One person brought onion | Others wanted to help too! |
| Everyone shared | Soup was AMAZING! |
| They ate together | They became friends! |

**Big Lesson:** One person sharing → Everyone sharing → COMMUNITY!

---

#### **Act It Out**
- **Scene 1:** Knock on doors, everyone says NO
- **Scene 2:** Put stone in pot (use a rock!)
- **Scene 3:** Everyone brings ingredients—PLOP! PLOP! PLOP!

Take turns being travelers and villagers!

- Make REAL soup together!
- Eat and share!

**Just like the story!** 🥣

---

#### **Cooperation & Community Discussion**

**What is cooperation?** Working together!

**What is community?** People helping each other!

**Questions:**
- Have YOU ever worked together with others to make something?
- What happens when everyone helps?
- Is it better to share or keep things to yourself?
- How did the villagers feel at the END vs. the BEGINNING?

---

#### **Magic E Hunt!**

Go through the story and find ALL the Magic E words!

**Challenge:** Can you find at least 20?

(There are: made, came, gave, take, taste, place, same, name, safe, plates, nice, time, stone, home, bone, those, close, alone, rude, huge, cute, use... and more!)

---

#### **Change Short to Long!**

Practice the Magic E rule:

| Short Vowel | Add Magic E | Long Vowel |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| mad | made | (long a) |
| hop | hope | (long o) |
| us | use | (long u) |
| bit | bite | (long i) |
| pet | Pete | (long e) |

**Try it!** What other words can you change with Magic E?

---

#### **Compare to Other Stories**

- **Enormous Turnip:** Everyone worked together to pull the turnip
- **Bremen Musicians:** Animals worked together to scare robbers
- **Stone Soup:** Villagers worked together to make soup
- **Pattern:** TEAMWORK = SUCCESS!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**

Billy the Goat says: "Stone soup teaches us about Magic E AND about sharing! Just like the villagers each brought ONE thing and made something AMAZING, when you learn ONE skill at a time (like Magic E!), you can READ amazing books! Each little bit adds up!"

Also: The travelers were CLEVER! They used the 'stone soup' trick to get people to share. In reading, Magic E is like a TRICK too—a silent E that changes everything!
