## The Story

"Who's that trip-trapping over my bridge?" roared the troll. [LOUD ROAR!]

"It is I, the tiniest billy goat!" squeaked the wee goat. [TINY VOICE!]

"I'm going to gobble you up!" bellowed the troll.

"Oh, please don't!" begged the wee goat. "Wait for my bigger brother!" [SCARED!]

The medium goat's hooves went CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP!

"Who's THAT trip-trapping?" demanded the troll. [ANGRY!]

"It's me, the middle billy goat!" called the medium goat. [MEDIUM VOICE!]

At last came the BIGGEST goat. STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!

"WHO'S THAT STOMPING OVER MY BRIDGE?!" screamed the troll. [TERRIFIED!]

"It is I, the GREAT BIG billy goat!" boomed the big goat. [HUGE VOICE!]

The big goat lowered his horns and CHARGED! BONK! SPLASH! The troll fell into the river!

All three goats lived happily on the hilltop, munching the sweet grass. Nom, nom, nom!

**The end!**
