**Chinese Folk Tale**

Long ago in China, first sons got long, important names. Second sons got short names.

A mother had two sons:
- **First son:** Tikki Tikki Tembo-No Sa Rembo-Chari Bari Ruchi-Pip Peri Pembo (VERY LONG!)
- **Second son:** Chang (short!)

One day, Chang fell in the well! Tikki Tikki Tembo ran to their mother.

"Mother! Chang fell in the well!"

Mother called the Old Man with the Ladder. He rescued Chang quickly!

Later, Tikki Tikki Tembo fell in the well! Chang ran to mother.

"Mother! Tikki Tikki Tembo-No Sa Rembo-Chari Bari Ruchi-Pip Peri Pembo fell in the well!"

"Say that again?" asked Mother.

"Tikki Tikki Tembo-No Sa Rembo-Chari Bari Ruchi-Pip Peri Pembo fell in the well!"

By the time the Old Man arrived with the ladder, Tikki Tikki Tembo had been in the water a LONG time!

They saved him, but from then on, Chinese families gave ALL their children short names!

**Categories:**
- **Family words:** mother, son, brother, father
- **Place words:** well, home, ladder
- **Action words:** fell, ran, called, rescued

**Lesson:** Long names cause problems! Short names are practical!

**Humor:** Try saying "Tikki Tikki Tembo-No Sa Rembo-Chari Bari Ruchi-Pip Peri Pembo" fast three times!
