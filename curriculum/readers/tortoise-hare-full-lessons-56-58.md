## The Story

### Page 1
One day, Hare **was** hopping **around** the forest.

He **was** **very** fast. And he **was** **very** **proud** of it.

"Look **how** fast I am!" Hare would **shout**. "No one can beat me!"

Tortoise walked by, **slow** and steady.

Hare laughed. "**How** can you move so slowly? You are like a snail!"

[Hare is VERY proud! He brags a lot!]

---

### Page 2
Tortoise did not get upset. He said calmly, "I may be **slow**, but I always get where I am going."

"Ha!" laughed Hare. "You? Get anywhere? That takes you all day!"

"Let's have a race," said Tortoise. "From here to the big oak tree **down** by the stream."

Hare's eyes grew wide. Then he **burst** **out** laughing!

"You? Race me? This will be easy!" Hare said **proudly**.

[Tortoise challenged Hare! Hare thinks it's funny!]

---

### Page 3
All the forest animals came **out** to watch.

Fox stood at the starting line. "On your mark... get set... GO!"

Hare shot **down** the path like lightning! **Zoom!**

Tortoise began to walk, **slow** and steady. One step at a time.

"**How** is this even a race?" laughed Hare as he looked back. Tortoise **was** just a tiny dot far behind.

[Hare is SO fast! Tortoise is SO slow!]

---

### Page 4
Hare ran and ran. Soon, he **was** halfway to the oak tree.

He looked **around**. Tortoise **was** nowhere in sight!

"I am so far ahead!" Hare said **proudly**. "Tortoise is probably still at the start! I have plenty of time."

Hare sat **down** under a shady tree. "I will rest here for a bit. When Tortoise gets close, I will run and win!"

[Hare is resting! He thinks he has lots of time!]

---

### Page 5
Hare lay **down** on the soft grass. The sun **was** warm. The breeze **was** cool.

"Just a short nap," Hare said. "Then I will **race** to the finish line."

Hare closed his eyes. Soon, he **was** fast asleep. He began to snore.

**"Zzzzzz... zzzzz..."**

[Uh oh! Hare fell asleep!]

---

### Page 6
Meanwhile, Tortoise kept walking. **Slow** and steady. One step. Then another. Then another.

Step... step... step...

He did not stop. He did not rest. He just kept going.

After a while, Tortoise walked past the shady tree. He saw Hare sleeping on the **ground**!

Tortoise smiled. But he did not **shout**. He did not **wake** Hare. He just kept walking.

[Tortoise passes Hare! Hare is still sleeping!]

---

### Page 7
Tortoise walked and walked. **Slow** and steady.

Up the hill. **Down** the hill. **Around** the bend.

**Now** the big oak tree **was** in sight!

Tortoise kept going. Step... step... step...

He **was** getting close! Very close!

[Tortoise is almost there!]

---

### Page 8
Back at the shady tree, Hare woke up!

He stretched and yawned. "**How** long **was** I asleep?" he wondered.

He looked **around**. Still no sign of Tortoise!

"Good!" said Hare. "I still have time!"

Hare hopped **down** the path. He **was** not worried. "I will win this race easily!" he said **proudly**.

[Hare thinks he's still ahead!]

---

### Page 9
But as Hare came **around** the bend, he **stopped**.

What did he see?

Tortoise **was** at the oak tree! The finish line!

All the animals were cheering! "**Tortoise won! Tortoise won!**"

Hare's m**outh** fell open. "**How** did this happen?" he cried.

[TORTOISE WON! Hare is shocked!]

---

### Page 10
Hare ran as fast as he could! He zoomed **down** the path!

But it **was** too late. Tortoise had already crossed the finish line!

Hare stopped, panting. "I... I lost?" he said. "But I am so fast! **How** did you beat me?"

Tortoise smiled. "You were fast, Hare. But you **stopped**. I kept going. **Slow** and steady wins the race."

[Tortoise teaches Hare a lesson!]

---

### Page 11
Hare hung his head. He **was** not **proud** anymore. He **was** embarrassed.

"You are right," Hare said. "I **was** too **proud**. I thought I could not lose. But I **did**."

"It is good to be fast," said Tortoise kindly. "But it is also good to keep trying and not give up. Speed is not everything."

Hare nodded. "You have taught me a lesson, Tortoise. Thank you."

[Hare learned his lesson!]

---

### Page 12
From that day on, Hare **was** still fast. But he **was** not so **proud**.

And he never **boasted** again.

Tortoise kept walking, **slow** and steady, just as always.

**THE END**

**Slow and steady wins the race!**

[The classic lesson: Don't give up! Keep going!]
