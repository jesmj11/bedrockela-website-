### Extension Activities

#### **Setting Comparison Chart**

| COUNTRY | TOWN |
|---------|------|
| Small den in grass | Grand house |
| Fresh, plain food | Rich, fancy food |
| Quiet and peaceful | Busy and dangerous |
| No cats or dogs | Cats and dogs everywhere! |
| Country Mouse was HAPPY | Country Mouse was SCARED |

**Question:** Which setting would YOU like better?

---

#### **Where Stories Happen (SETTING)**
**Setting** = WHERE and WHEN a story happens

This story has TWO settings:
1. **Country** (grass, small den, peaceful)
2. **Town** (big house, lots of people, carts, danger)

**Practice:**
- Billy Goats Gruff: WHERE? (bridge, hill with grass)
- Three Little Pigs: WHERE? (woods, three houses)
- Goldilocks: WHERE? (woods, bears' den)
- This story: TWO places! Country AND Town!

---

#### **Compare & Contrast**
**SAME:**
- Both mice
- Both have cheese
- Both are friends

**DIFFERENT:**
- Country Mouse: simple food, peaceful, happy
- Town Mouse: rich food, dangerous, scared (well, Country Mouse got scared!)

**Which is BETTER?**
- Depends on what YOU like!
- Country Mouse liked peace more than fancy food
- What do YOU value more?

---

#### **Act It Out**
- **Scene 1:** Country—sit in "grass," munch simple food, peaceful
- **Scene 2:** Town—see all the fancy food! Start eating...
- **Scene 3:** CAT! Run and hide! (meow!)
- **Scene 4:** DOG! Run and hide! (woof!)
- **Scene 5:** Country Mouse goes home, happy and safe

Take turns being each mouse!

---

#### **Draw the Two Settings**
- **Left side of paper:** Draw the COUNTRY (grass, small den, peach tree, peaceful)
- **Right side of paper:** Draw the TOWN (big house, lots of food, cat, dog, busy)
- Label each one!

---

#### **Character Preferences**
Why did the Country Mouse choose to go home?
- He liked PEACE more than RICH FOOD
- He would rather be SAFE and HAPPY than FANCY and SCARED
- **Home is where you're happy!**

**Talk about it:**
- What makes YOU happy?
- Do you like busy places or quiet places?
- Is "fancy" always better? (NO!)

---

#### **Theme: There's No Place Like Home**
**The lesson:** Home is the best place to be—not because it's fanciest, but because you're HAPPY there!

**Questions:**
- What do you like about YOUR home?
- Does "home" have to be fancy? (NO!)
- Can you be happy in a simple place? (YES!)

---

#### **Compare to Other Fables**
- **Lion & Mouse:** Small can help big
- **Fox & Grapes:** Don't make excuses
- **Town & Country Mouse:** Home is where you're happy
- **All Aesop's Fables:** They teach lessons!

---

#### **Billy's Connection**
Billy the Goat says: "I live on a mountain! Not fancy, but I LOVE it! You don't need the fanciest books or the biggest library—you just need stories that make you HAPPY! Find what you love to read, and THAT'S your 'home' in reading!"

Also: The Country Mouse had to RUN FAST from danger! When you practice blends like "fast," "friend," and "fresh," you're getting FASTER at reading!
