# The Velveteen Rabbit
## Lessons 109-111 - Suffixes & Word Families

A stuffed rabbit wanted to become REAL.

"What makes a toy real?" he asked the old Skin Horse.

"When a child loves you for a long time, you become real," said the Horse. "It doesn't happen all at once. You become. Being **real** is **wonderful**, even if it hurts some**times**."

The Boy loved the Rabbit. They were **together** constant**ly**. The Rabbit grew shabb**y** but **happy**.

Then the Boy got sick. The doctor said the Rabbit must be burned—it had germs.

The Rabbit cried. A fairy appeared. "You were **loved** true**ly**. I'll make you **real**!"

She kissed him. The Rabbit became a REAL rabbit! He hopped **joy**ful**ly** into the forest!

**Suffix Practice:**
- **-ful** = full of (wonder**ful** = full of wonder, joy**ful** = full of joy, care**ful** = full of care)
- **-ly** = in that way (constant**ly** = in a constant way, true**ly** = in a true way)
- **-less** = without (hope**less** = without hope, care**less** = without care)

**Word Families:**

- **love**, **loved**, **lovely**, **loveless** (root: love)
- **beauty**, **beautiful**, **beautifully** (root: beauty)
