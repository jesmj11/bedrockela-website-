# Where the Wild Things Are
## Lessons 117-118 - Position Words & Emotions

Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief. His mother sent him to bed with no supper.

**In** his room, a forest grew—**around** him, **over** the walls, **across** the floor!

An ocean tumbled **through** with a boat for Max. He sailed **away** **over** a year and **into** the night.

He came to where the wild things are! Terrible monsters **with** big eyes! They roared and gnashed!

Max tamed them **with** a magic trick. "BE STILL!" They made him king!

"Let the wild rumpus start!" Max commanded. They danced **under** the moon, **through** the trees, **over** the rocks!

But Max felt lonely. He smelled good food **from** **far** away—his supper waiting **at** home!

He sailed **back** **over** the ocean, **through** the forest, **into** his room. His supper was **on** the table, still hot!
