# Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears
## Lessons 104-105 - Inference & Cause/Effect Chain

**African Pourquoi Tale** (Pourquoi = "why" in French - tales that explain WHY things are!)

**The Cause & Effect Chain:**

Mosquito told Iguana a lie → Iguana got annoyed and put sticks in his ears → Iguana couldn't hear Python's greeting → Python thought Iguana was mad at him → Python hid in Rabbit's hole → Rabbit ran away scared → Rabbit scared Crow → Crow alarmed the Monkey → Monkey jumped and broke a branch → Branch fell and killed an owlet → Mother Owl was heartbroken and wouldn't wake the sun → The world stayed dark!

**Making Inferences:**

Q: Why did Iguana put sticks in his ears?  
A: (Inference: He didn't want to hear Mosquito's annoying lies!)

Q: Why didn't Python know Iguana wasn't really mad?  
A: (Inference: Iguana couldn't hear to explain!)

Q: Why wouldn't Mother Owl wake the sun?  
A: (Inference: She was too sad about her baby!)

The animals held court. They traced the problem back... back... back... to MOSQUITO'S LIE!

Mother Owl forgave everyone. The sun rose! But Mosquito still feels guilty, so mosquitoes buzz "Is everyone still mad at me? Zzzzzz?"

**Lesson:** One small lie can cause BIG problems! Think before you act!

**Comprehension Focus:** Following a long cause/effect chain. Making inferences about WHY characters act certain ways.
