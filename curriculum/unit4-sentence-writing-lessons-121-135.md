## Lesson 121: What is a Sentence?

### Concept:
A sentence is a group of words that tells a complete thought. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

### Billy Says:
"A sentence is like a trail! It starts somewhere, goes somewhere, and ends somewhere. You can't just stop in the middle of the mountain!"

### Examples from Billy's World:
✅ **Complete Sentences:**
- Billy climbs the mountain.
- The goat eats grass.
- Mountains are tall.
- I see a bird.

❌ **NOT Complete Sentences:**
- Billy climbs (Where? What?)
- Eats grass (Who eats grass?)
- Are tall (What is tall?)

2. Climbs high. ___
3. The mountain is big. ___
4. Running fast. ___
5. I love mountains. ___

## Lesson 122: Capital Letter Climb

### Concept:
Every sentence starts with a capital letter—just like every trail starts at the bottom!

### Billy Says:
"Capital letters are like the first step on a trail. You ALWAYS start at the beginning!"

### Examples:
✅ Billy climbs.  
✅ Mountains are fun.

## Lesson 123: End Mark Mountain

### Concept:
Every sentence needs an end mark: period (.) question mark (?) or exclamation point (!)

### Billy Says:
"End marks are like reaching a viewpoint—you STOP and look! Each mark tells you how to feel!"

### The Three End Marks:

**Period (.)** = Telling/Statement
- Billy climbs the mountain.
- I see a bird.

**Question Mark (?)** = Asking
- Where is Billy?
- Can goats climb?

**Exclamation Point (!)** = Excitement/Strong Feeling
- Watch out for that rock!
- Billy reached the top!

### Practice Activity:
**Add the correct end mark:**

1. Billy is hungry___
2. Where is the trail___
3. Wow, what a view___
4. Goats have hooves___
5. Can you see the top___
6. Help, I'm slipping___
