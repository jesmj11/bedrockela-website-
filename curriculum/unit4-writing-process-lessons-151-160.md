**2. Organize:** Put ideas in order
- What comes first?
- What comes next?
- How does it end?

**3. Planning Web:**
```
        [Detail]
           |
    [TOPIC] - [Detail]
           |
        [Detail]
```

## Lesson 152: First Draft Fun

### Concept:
A first draft is your first try at writing. It doesn't have to be perfect!

### Billy Says:
