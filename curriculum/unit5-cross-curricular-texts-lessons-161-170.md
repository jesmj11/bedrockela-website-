## Lesson 161: Science on the Mountain - How Mountains Form

### Billy Says:
"Ever wonder how mountains are made? Let me teach you the science!"

### The Story:

**How Mountains Are Made**

Mountains are very tall landforms. But how do they form? It takes millions of years!

**Tectonic Plates:**  
The Earth's crust is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates move very slowly—so slow you can't feel it!

**When Plates Collide:**  
Sometimes two plates push into each other. When they push, the land buckles and folds upward. Over millions of years, this creates mountains!

**Types of Mountains:**  
- **Fold Mountains:** Made when plates push together (like the Rockies!)
- **Volcanic Mountains:** Made when magma erupts and hardens
- **Block Mountains:** Made when huge blocks of rock are pushed up

**Fun Fact:** Mount Everest, the tallest mountain, is still growing! It gets taller by a tiny bit each year!

### Comprehension Questions:
1. What are tectonic plates?
2. What happens when two plates push together?
3. How long does it take to make a mountain?
4. Name one type of mountain.
5. Is Mount Everest still growing?

Mountains high, mountains tall,

Where eagles soar and clouds drift by.

Climbing up the winding trail,  
Through the wind and sometimes hail.  
When I reach the mountain top,  
All my worries seem to stop.

Mountains sing a quiet song.  
If you listen, you will hear,  
Nature's music, pure and clear.
